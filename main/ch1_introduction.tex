\section{The need for new sources of energy}



\section{Nuclear fusion as a source of energy}
Nuclear fusion is the process of forming a nucleus from two, lighter nuclei. This, in particular, is the process that powers all stars in the universe. Nuclear \emph{fusion} is the opposite of nuclear \emph{fission}, where two nuclei are formed by breaking one, heavier nucleus. Nuclear fission is commonly used to power nuclear fission power plants.

Atomic nuclei are composed of neutron and protons, and are kept bound together by the strong interaction. The binding energy of the nucleon, defined as the minimum energy required to separate a nucleus as a collection of its nucleon, measures then how tightly bound a nucleus is. The binding energy per nucleon, shown on Figure \ref{fig. binding energy}, is low for hydrogen, grows with atomic number until reaching a maximum for the iron, and then decreases with increasing atomic number. Fusing two nuclei lighter than iron will then, in general, release energy.

Of particular interest for commercial fusion power plants is the fusion of deuterium $\ce{H2}$ with tritium $\ce{H3}$, which generates a nucleus of helium $\ce{He4}$ with $3.5$MeV of kinetic energy, and a neutron with $14.1$MeV of kinetic energy (see Figure \ref{fig. dt fusion}). Among potential fusion reactions, this is the most promising, because the reaction cross-section is the highest. Nevertheless, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions require a temperate of at least $10$keV, \textit{i.e.} 100 millions degrees.

The challenge is then to confine the fuel, which forms a plasma at these temperature, for a sufficient time such that enough reactions have the time to occur. More specifically, to get energy break-even (\textit{i.e.} to get as much fusion power as input power, $Q=F_{fus}/P_{in}=1$), one can derive the so-called Lawson criterion \citep{lawsonCriteriaPowerProducing1957}, which gives a criterion on the fusion triple product,
\begin{equation}
    nT\tau_E > 1.5\cdot 10^{21}\text{keV s m}^{-3}, 
\end{equation} 
where $n$ is the plasma density, $T$ is its temperature, and $\tau_E$ is the energy confinement time. In addition, the plasma temperature cannot be too low nor too large, otherwise Bremsstrahlung losses would be too large. From this simple criterion, one can identify two paths toward a nuclear fusion power plant: (i) inertial fusion, where one maximizes the density for a very short amount of time, or (ii) magnetic confinement, where one keeps comparatively lower densities, but increases as much as possible the energy confinement time. This thesis will focus on one particular design of magnetic confinement reactor called the stellarator, which we explain in the next section.
