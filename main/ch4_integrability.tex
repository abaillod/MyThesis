\chapter{Measures of field line integrability}

In view to assess the capability of a magnetic equilibrium to confine a plasma, one has to define physics based metrics. In particular, to assess the quality of its 
magnetic surfaces, it is important to have numerical diagnostics that can determine the topology of a magnetic field line, and how well it confines a plasma. In this chapter, we introduce three different metrics, namely the Greene's residue \citep{Greene1968,Greene1978}, the volume of chaos \citep{Loizu2017}, and the fraction of net parallel diffusion ({\color{red} cite your paper}).
