  abstract = {In the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator, the vacuum rotational transform, {$\iota$} , has a flat radial profile and does not cross any major rational resonance. Nevertheless, during plasma operation the {$\iota$} -profile can be strongly modified by electron cyclotron current drive in such a way that the resulting {$\iota$} -profile passes through low-order rational values, and this can trigger magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) events. Indeed, W7-X plasmas are sometimes subject to repetitive collapses of core confinement, which can be observed regardless of the direction in which the EC current is driven. Even though the origin of these MHD instabilities is under investigation, the crashes may be connected to the formation of magnetic islands and magnetic reconnection. In the present work, we try to shed light on the dynamics of different events happening during the course of sawtooth cycles in W7-X by proposing a model that combines a slow current diffusion with a recipe for fast relaxation that conserves the corresponding helical flux (Kadomtsev 1975 Fiz. Plazmy 1 710\textendash 15). We also propose a simple model based on Taylor relaxation (Taylor 1974 Phys. Rev. Lett. 33 1139), (Taylor 1986 Rev. Mod. Phys. 58 741) to predict the nonlinear redistribution of plasma current caused by the largest of the observed events.},

The nested magnetic surfaces in W7-X are created by a system of 3-D toroidally discrete coils, providing both toroidal and poloidal field components, and designed with the aim to create optimum equilibrium properties. The optimization criteria included the high quality of vacuum magnetic surfaces, good finite beta equilibrium and MHD-stability properties as well as a substantial reduction of the neoclassical transport and bootstrap current in comparison to classical stellarators. Equilibrium calculations, devoted to the analysis of the experiment programs dedicated to measure the bootstrap current, were performed with help of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code, available as Wendelstein 7-X web service. Pressure profiles based on experimental data served as an input for calculations. The mapping of measurements using pre-calculated equilibria for different beta values has been analyzed. A comparison with reconstruction results obtained by means of the Minerva Framework, considering only experimental data of magnetics measurements, and the V3FIT code is presented.},

Shape gradients can be applied to gradient-based optimization, sensitivity analysis and tolerance calculation. An efficient method for computing the shape gradient for toroidal three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria is presented. The method is based on the self-adjoint property of the equations for driven perturbations of MHD equilibria and is similar to the Onsager symmetry of transport coefficients. Two versions of the shape gradient are considered. One describes the change in a figure of merit due to an arbitrary displacement of the outer flux surface; the other describes the change in the figure of merit due to the displacement of a coil. The method is implemented for several example figures of merit and compared with direct calculation of the shape gradient. In these examples the adjoint method reduces the number of equilibrium computations by factors of    \$O(N)\$   , where    \$N\$   is the number of parameters used to describe the outer flux surface or coil shapes.},

Our focus is mainly on the HDI and its evolution and unsolved technical issues. Was the HDI successful as an alternative? Given that the established goal was to provide an alternative index to the unidimensional and income centred previous indicators, HDI represents indeed advancement, both in terms of the characterisation of the multidimensional nature of development and in terms of its refined theoretical basis. On the other hand, arguments claiming the introduction of a completely new paradigm, showing a change from the concentration on means towards the promotion of human ends, are far from being settled. The claim that HDI is a capability measure, considered the most basic human capabilities, also remains elusive.},

Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)] could be optimized for good magnetic surfaces in vacuum. In this paper, we build upon their work to show the first finite- {$\beta$}, fixed-, and free-boundary optimization of SPEC equilibria for good magnetic surfaces. The objective function is constructed with the Greene's residue of selected rational surfaces, and the optimization is driven by the SIMSOPT framework [Landreman et al., J. Open Source Software 6, 3525 (2021)]. We show that the size of magnetic islands and the consequent regions occupied by chaotic field lines can be minimized in a classical stellarator geometry (rotating ellipse) by optimizing either the injected toroidal current profile, the shape of a perfectly conducting wall surrounding the plasma (fixed-boundary case), or the vacuum field produced by the coils (free-boundary case). This work shows that SPEC can be used as an equilibrium code both in a two-step or single-step stellarator optimization loop.},

  abstract = {Research on magnetic confinement of high-temperature plasmas has the ultimate goal of harnessing nuclear fusion for the production of electricity. Although the tokamak1 is the leading toroidal magnetic-confinement concept, it is not without shortcomings and the fusion community has therefore also pursued alternative concepts such as the stellarator. Unlike axisymmetric tokamaks, stellarators possess a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field geometry. The availability of this additional dimension opens up an extensive configuration space for computational optimization of both the field geometry itself and the current-carrying coils that produce it. Such an optimization was undertaken in designing Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)2, a large helical-axis advanced stellarator (HELIAS), which began operation in 2015 at Greifswald, Germany. A major drawback of 3D magnetic field geometry, however, is that it introduces a strong temperature dependence into the stellarator's non-turbulent `neoclassical' energy transport. Indeed, such energy losses will become prohibitive in high-temperature reactor plasmas unless a strong reduction of the geometrical factor associated with this transport can be achieved; such a reduction was therefore a principal goal of the design of W7-X. In spite of the modest heating power currently available, W7-X has already been able to achieve high-temperature plasma conditions during its 2017 and 2018 experimental campaigns, producing record values of the fusion triple product for such stellarator plasmas3,4. The triple product of plasma density, ion temperature and energy confinement time is used in fusion research as a figure of merit, as it must attain a certain threshold value before net-energy-producing operation of a reactor becomes possible1,5. Here we demonstrate that such record values provide evidence for reduced neoclassical energy transport in W7-X, as the plasma profiles that produced these results could not have been obtained in stellarators lacking a comparably high level of neoclassical optimization.},

  abstract = {A fully three-dimensional spectral code has been developed and implemented. It computes three-dimensional equilibria using the variational approach, by minimizing the potential energy subject to appropriate constraints. A second minimization, with an additional constraint, is used to examine the stability of solutions. The magnetic field representation allows for non-nested flux surfaces. Thus it can be used to study solutions with islands and variation of the potential energy with respect to topology changes. A spectral representation in the toroidal and poloidal angles, coupled with a special choice of collocation points in the radial direction results in greatly enhanced resolution. A fast iterative method was developed, with the number of iterations required for convergence independent of the mesh size. Residuals converge exponentially to the round-off error, allowing the potential energy to be computed to the eight-digit accuracy required for nonlinear stability analysis. A small amount of artificial viscosity may be needed for convergence in cases where low-order resonances are present in the plasma region. Numerical results show convergence to known axially symmetric equilibrium solutions, as well as close agreement with eigenvalue calculations in helically symmetric stellarator configurations. Solutions exhibiting island formations are found to have lower potential energy than that of the nearby nested case. Internal modes are found to localize inside the resonant surface, with the eigenfunction having sharp gradients at the resonant surface.

  abstract = {The Human Development Index (HDI) is one of the most widely used composite indicators of socio-economic development. However, the HDI is at the cross-roads. In order to retain its flagship role in the development arena, many scholars have called from the HDI to reinvent itself by adding sustainability dimensions. The aim of this paper is to introduce the Sustainable Human Development Index (SHDI), based on Multidimensional Synthesis of Indicators (MSI) \textendash{} a new class of indexes that can be used for monitoring Sustainable Human Development (SHD). The approach we propose aims to address two primary issues regarding the HDI. The first issue involves the integration into the SHDI of two important sustainability-related dimensions that are missing in the HDI; namely, the environment and freedom (defined here in terms of political rights and civil liberties). The second issue focuses on the method of aggregation using the new class of indexes proposed. We aim to expand on the three standard HDI dimensions while avoiding problems associated with the geometric mean that tends to collapse to zero. In doing so, we manage to retain the same theoretical intuitions of the post-2010 HDI approach, i.e. to penalize the heterogeneity of outcomes. Moreover, we rely on the flexibility of the MSI approach to develop another index, the Environmentally-centered Sustainable Human Development Index (ESHDI), which puts the environmental dimension at the core of the analysis. In the first part of the paper we introduce the theoretical debate on the multidimensionality of the HDI, and consider the two new dimensions of sustainability, as well as the MSI aggregation approach. In the second part, the SHDI and the ESHDI are introduced, tested through a simulation analysis, and are compared with the HDI geometric mean using 2013 data. The simulations and the results of the empirical analysis show how the new class of indexes provide a more flexible approach to the procedure of aggregation, especially when the number of dimensions increases and/or when there is the need to stress the importance of one or more dimensions. The introduction of the two environmental and freedom sustainability dimensions greatly increases the potential of the HDI to address the SHD paradigm by capturing two core issues for the humanity and its common future.},

Thus, the physical plant is moving toward completion, and systems are entering the commissioning phase. Manufacturing progress is equally impressive. The base and lower cylinder of the cryostat have been assembled on the ITER site. Three of the six poloidal field coils and the first of the six modules of the central solenoid are being wound. The winding packs and casings for the first toroidal field magnets are complete, and the parts for the first vacuum vessel sector have been fabricated and are on progress to be assembled. The Heating and Current Drive systems are in the final design phase. The ITER operational timeline from First Plasma at the end of 2025 to achievement of the project goals has been revised in a stepwise installation of components and auxiliary systems followed by commissioning and operations; all systems will be installed before the start of the fusion power operational phase at the end of 2035.

(1) Even a small toroidal asymmetry in the magnetic field strength, {$\delta$} {$\equiv$} {$\partial$} ln B/{$\partial\varphi$} {$\sim$} 10-4, can cause an unacceptable degradation in performance. (2) Nevertheless, asymmetries - even large asymmetries {$\delta$} {$\sim$} 1 - can give beneficial plasma control and circumvent issues, such as magnetic-configuration maintenance and plasma disruptions, that make axisymmetric fusion devices problematic. Viewed from prospectives that are adequate for designing and studying axisymmetric plasmas, the physics of non-axisymmetric plasmas appears dauntingly difficult. Remarkably, Maxwell's equations provide such strong constraints on the physics of toroidal fusion plasmas that even a black-box model of a plasma answers many important questions. Kinetic theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics provide further, but more nuanced, constraints. This paper is organized so these constraints can be used as a basis for the innovations and for the extrapolations that are required to go from existing experiments to fusion systems. Outlines are given of a number of calculations that would be of great importance to ITER and to the overall fusion program and that could be carried out now with limited resources.},

We say a magnetic field is isodrastic if guiding centres make no transitions between classes of motion. Therefore, this is an important ideal for enhancing confinement. First, we present a weak formulation, based on the longitudinal adiabatic invariant, generalising omnigenity. To demonstrate that isodrasticity is strictly more general than omnigenity, we construct weakly isodrastic mirror fields that are not omnigenous. Then we present a strong formulation that is exact for guiding-centre motion. We develop a first-order treatment of the strong version via a Melnikov function and show that it recovers the weak version. The theory provides quantification of deviations from isodrasticity that can be used as objective functions in optimal design. The theory is illustrated on some simple examples.},

First considering an idealized magnetic configuration, we add a non generic perturbation corresponding to a magnetic ripple, breaking one of the invariant of the motion. Chaotic motion is then observed and opens questions about the link between chaos of magnetic field lines and chaos of particle trajectories. Second, we return to a axi-symmetric configuration and tune the safety factor (magnetic configuration) in order to recover chaotic motion. In this last setting with two constants of the motion, the presence of chaos implies that no third global constant exists, we highlight this fact by looking at variations of the first order of the magnetic moment in this chaotic setting. We are facing a mixed phase space with both regular and chaotic regions and point out the difficulties in performing a global reduction such as gyrokinetics.},

  abstract = {Coil complexity is a critical consideration in stellarator design. The traditional two-step optimization approach, in which the plasma boundary is optimized for physics properties and the coils are subsequently optimized to be consistent with this boundary, can result in plasma shapes which cannot be produced with sufficiently simple coils. To address this challenge, we propose a method to incorporate considerations of coil complexity in the optimization of the plasma boundary. Coil complexity metrics are computed from the current potential solution obtained with the REGCOIL code (Landreman, Nucl. Fusion, vol. 57, 2017, 046003). While such metrics have previously been included in derivative-free fixed-boundary optimization (Drevlak et al., Nucl. Fusion, vol. 59, 2018, 016010), we compute the local sensitivity of these metrics with respect to perturbations of the plasma boundary using the shape gradient (Landreman \& Paul, Nucl. Fusion, vol. 58, 2018, 076023). We extend REGCOIL to compute derivatives of these metrics with respect to parameters describing the plasma boundary. In keeping with previous research on winding surface optimization (Paul et al., Nucl. Fusion, vol. 58, 2018, 076015), the shape derivatives are computed with a discrete adjoint method. In contrast with the previous work, derivatives are computed with respect to the plasma surface parameters rather than the winding surface parameters. To further reduce the resolution required to compute the shape gradient, we present a more efficient representation of the plasma surface which uses a single Fourier series to describe the radial distance from a coordinate axis and a spectrally condensed poloidal angle. This representation is advantageous over the standard cylindrical representation used in the VMEC code (Hirshman \& Whitson, Phys. Fluids, vol. 26, 1983, pp. 3553\textendash 3568), as it provides a uniquely defined poloidal angle, eliminating a null space in the optimization of the plasma surface. In comparison with previous spectral condensation methods (Hirshman \& Breslau, Phys. Plasmas, vol. 5, 1998, p. 2664), the modified poloidal angle is obtained algebraically rather than through the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. The resulting shape gradient highlights features of the plasma boundary that are consistent with simple coils and can be used to couple coil and fixed-boundary optimization.},

These currents are found by a nonlinear analysis valid in the vicinity of the island. The result is a set of coupled nonlinear equations determining the island widths. Scaling is found by using the approximation of nearly circular flux surfaces. The results indicate that for typical stellarators, which have a small ratio \L l o/m o of field line rotational transform to coil rotational transform, the island size in the low-{$\beta$} limit depends dramatically on whether a magnetic well is present. In this case, if a magnetic well is present, islands are insignificant; in contrast, if a magnetic hill is present, island overlap occurs for arbitrarily low pressure. \textcopyright{} 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

The location of the invariant torus is enforced in the vicinity of the chosen target (at a distance of order {$\epsilon$} due to the angle dependence). Given the importance of confinement in magnetic fusion devices, the method is applied to two examples with a loss of magnetic confinement. In the case of locked tearing modes, an invariant torus can be restored that aims at showing the current quench and therefore the generation of runaway electrons. In the second case, the method is applied to the control of stochastic boundaries allowing one to define a transport barrier within the stochastic boundary and therefore to monitor the volume of closed field lines. \textcopyright{} 2006 IAEA, Vienna.},

A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion-to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics. \textcopyright{} 1979.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the route to fusion power involves large devices of ITER scale or larger. However, we show, contrary to expectations, that for steady state tokamaks operating at fixed fractions of the density and beta limits, the fusion gain, Q fus , depends mainly on the absolute level of the fusion power and the energy confinement, and only weakly on the device size. Our investigations are carried out using a system code and also by analytical means. Further, we show that for the two qualitatively different global scalings that have been developed to fit the data contained in the ITER ELMy H-mode database, i.e. the normally used beta-dependent IPB98 y 2 scaling and the alternative beta-independent scalings, the power needed for high fusion performance differs substantially, typically by factors of three to four. Taken together, these two findings imply that lower power, smaller, and hence potentially lower cost, pilot plants and reactors than currently envisaged may be possible. The main parameters of a candidate low power ({$\sim$}180 MW), high Q fus ({$\sim$}5), relatively small ({$\sim$}1.35 m major radius) device are given.},

  abstract = {The energy confinement time of tokamak plasmas scales positively with plasma size and so it is generally expected that the fusion triple product, nT{$\tau$} E, will also increase with size, and this has been part of the motivation for building devices of increasing size including ITER. Here n, T, and {$\tau$} E are the ion density, ion temperature and energy confinement time respectively. However, tokamak plasmas are subject to operational limits and two important limits are a density limit and a beta limit. We show that when these limits are taken into account, nT{$\tau$} E becomes almost independent of size; rather it depends mainly on the fusion power, P fus. In consequence, the fusion power gain, Q fus, a parameter closely linked to nT{$\tau$} E is also independent of size. Hence, P fus and Q fus, two parameters of critical importance in reactor design, are actually tightly coupled. Further, we find that nT{$\tau$} E is inversely dependent on the normalised beta, {$\beta$} N; an unexpected result that tends to favour lower power reactors. Our findings imply that the minimum power to achieve fusion reactor conditions is driven mainly by physics considerations, especially energy confinement, while the minimum device size is driven by technology and engineering considerations. Through dedicated R\&D and parallel developments in other fields, the technology and engineering aspects are evolving in a direction to make smaller devices feasible.},

In MRxMHD a linear Grad--Shafranov equation applies, even at finite ripple amplitude. The adiabatic switching on of boundary ripple excites a shielding current sheet opposing reconnection at a resonant surface. The perturbed magnetic field as a function of ripple amplitude is calculated by invoking conservation of magnetic helicity in the two regions separated by the current sheet. At low ripple amplitude "half islands" appear on each side of the current sheet, locking the rotational transform at the resonant value. Beyond a critical amplitude these islands disappear and the rotational transform develops a discontinuity across the current sheet.},

This is illustrated using a first-principles analysis of a two-region slab geometry, with periodic boundary conditions to model the outer regions of typical tokamak or reversed-field pinch plasmas. The lowest and second-lowest eigenvalues in plasmas unstable to tearing and kink-tearing modes are calculated.

An alternative definition of ghost surfaces is also introduced, based on an action-gradient flow in \$\textbackslash Theta\$, which appears to have superior properties when unified with QFMin surfaces.},

  abstract = {The two leading concepts for confining high-temperature fusion plasmas are the tokamak and the stellarator. Tokamaks are rotationally symmetric and use a large plasma current to achieve confinement, whereas stellarators are non-axisymmetric and employ three-dimensionally shaped magnetic field coils to twist the field and confine the plasma. As a result, the magnetic field of a stellarator needs to be carefully designed to minimize the collisional transport arising from poorly confined particle orbits, which would otherwise cause excessive power losses at high plasma temperatures. In addition, this type of transport leads to the appearance of a net toroidal plasma current, the so-called bootstrap current. Here, we analyse results from the first experimental campaign of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, showing that its magnetic-field design allows good control of bootstrap currents and collisional transport. The energy confinement time is among the best ever achieved in stellarators, both in absolute figures ({$\tau$}E {$>$} 100 ms) and relative to the stellarator confinement scaling. The bootstrap current responds as predicted to changes in the magnetic mirror ratio. These initial experiments confirm several theoretically predicted properties of Wendelstein 7-X plasmas, and already indicate consistency with optimization measures.},

Transferring the consistent field found by the variational moments equilibrium code (VMEC) (Hirshmann and Whitson 1983 Phys.

The approach directly solves the equilibrium force balance as a system of nonlinear equations in the form f (x) = 0. The independent variables x represent nested magnetic flux surfaces expressed in the inverse representation with toroidal flux coordinates, and the equations f (x) quantify equilibrium force balance errors at discrete points in real space. Discretizing with global Fourier-Zernike basis functions properly treats the magnetic axis and minimizes the number of coefficients needed to describe the flux surfaces. The pseudospectral method provides great flexibility in where the errors are evaluated, and the system of equations is efficiently solved with a Newton-Raphson iteration. Equilibria are computed and compared against VMEC for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric examples. The results show fast convergence rates and solutions with low errors throughout the plasma volume.},

This paper presents the current wall-embedded Langmuir probe system installed on the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV), as well as the analysis tool chain used to interpret the current-voltage characteristic obtained when the probes are operated in swept-bias conditions. The analysis is based on a four-parameter fit combined with a minimum temperature approach. In order to reduce the effect of plasma fluctuations and measurement noise, several current-voltage characteristics are usually averaged before proceeding to the fitting. The impact of this procedure on the results is investigated, as well as the possible role of finite resistances in the circuitry, which could lead to an overestimation of the temperature. We study the application of the procedure in a specific regime, the plasma detachment, where results from other diagnostics indicate that the electron temperature derived from the Langmuir probes might be overestimated. To address this issue, we explore other fitting models and, in particular, an extension of the asymmetric double probe fit, which features effects of sheath expansion. We show that these models yield lower temperatures (up to approximately 60\%) than the standard analysis in detached conditions, particularly for a temperature peak observed near the plasma strike point, but a discrepancy with other measurements remains. We explore a possible explanation for this observation, the presence of a fast electron population, and assess how robust the different methods are in such conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to bridge the gap between tokamak reactor design and plasma physics. The analysis demonstrates that the overall design of a tokamak fusion reactor is determined almost entirely by the constraints imposed by nuclear physics and fusion engineering. Virtually, no plasma physics is required to determine the main design parameters of a reactor: a, R0, B0, Ti, Te, p, n, {$\tau$}E, I. The one exception is the value of the toroidal current I , which depends upon a combination of engineering and plasma physics. This exception, however, ultimately has a major impact on the feasibility of an attractive tokamak reactor. The analysis shows that the engineering/nuclear physics design makes demands on the plasma physics that must be satisfied in order to generate power. These demands are substituted into the well-known operational constraints arising in tokamak physics: the Troyon limit, Greenwald limit, kink stability limit, and bootstrap fraction limit. Unfortunately, a tokamak reactor designed on the basis of standard engineering and nuclear physics constraints does not scale to a reactor. Too much current is required to achieve the necessary confinement time for ignition. The combination of achievable bootstrap current plus current drive is not sufficient to generate the current demanded by the engineering design. Several possible solutions are discussed in detail involving advances in plasma physics or engineering. The main contribution of the present work is to demonstrate that the basic reactor design and its plasma physics consequences can be determined simply and analytically. The analysis thus provides a crisp, compact, logical framework that will hopefully lead to improved physical intuition for connecting plasma physic to tokamak reactor design.},

  abstract = {A major objective of the experimental program in the last phase of the W7-AS stellarator was to explore and demonstrate the high-{$\beta$} performance of advanced stellarators. MHD-quiescent discharges at low impurity radiation levels with volume averaged {$\beta$}-values of up to ?{$\beta$}?= 3.4\% have been achieved. A very important prerequisite was the attainment of the high density H-Mode (HDH) regime. This was made possible by the installation ofextensive graphite plasma facing components designed for island divertor operation. The co-directed neutral beam injection provided increased absorbed heating power of up to 3.2MW in high-{$\beta$} plasmas with B ? 1.25 T. The anticipated improved features concerning equilibrium and stability at high plasma {$\beta$} could be verified experimentally by the comparison of x-ray data with free boundary equilibrium calculations. The maximum {$\beta$} found in configurations with a rotational transform around ?{$\iota$} = 0.5 is determined by the available heating power. No evidence ofa stability limit has been found in the accessible configuration space, and the discharges are remarkably quiescent at maximum {$\beta$}, most likely due the increase of the magnetic well depth. An increase in low m/n MHD activity is typically observed during the transition towards high {$\beta$}. The beneficial stability properties of net-current-free configurations could be demonstrated by comparison with configurations where a significant inductive current drive was involved. Current driven instabilities such as tearing modes and soft disruptions can prevent access to {$\beta$}-values as high as in the currentless case. The experimental results indicate that optimized stellarators such as W7-X can be considered as a viable option for an attractive stellarator fusion reactor.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 IAEA, Vienna. Computational optimization has revolutionized the field of stellarator design. To date, optimizations have focused primarily on optimization of neoclassical confinement and ideal MHD stability, although limited optimization of other parameters has also been performed. The purpose of this paper is to outline a select set of new concepts for stellarator optimization that, when taken as a group, present a significant step forward in the stellarator concept. One of the criticisms that has been leveled at existing methods of design is the complexity of the resultant field coils. Recently, a new coil optimization code - COILOPT++, which uses a spline instead of a Fourier representation of the coils, - was written and included in the STELLOPT suite of codes. The advantage of this method is that it allows the addition of real space constraints on the locations of the coils. The code has been tested by generating coil designs for optimized quasi-axisymmetric stellarator plasma configurations of different aspect ratios. As an initial exercise, a constraint that the windings be vertical was placed on large major radius half of the non-planar coils. Further constraints were also imposed that guaranteed that sector blanket modules could be removed from between the coils, enabling a sector maintenance scheme. Results of this exercise will be presented. New ideas on methods for the optimization of turbulent transport have garnered much attention since these methods have led to design concepts that are calculated to have reduced turbulent heat loss. We have explored possibilities for generating an experimental database to test whether the reduction in transport that is predicted is consistent with experimental observations. To this end, a series of equilibria that can be made in the now latent QUASAR experiment have been identified that will test the predicted transport scalings. Fast particle confinement studies aimed at developing a generalized optimization algorithm are also discussed. A new algorithm developed for the design of the scraper element on W7-X is presented along with ideas for automating the optimization approach.},

A wide range of parameters has been covered in the experiments with and without net toroidal currents. Experimental data are compared with free-boundary equilibrium calculations and exhibit good agreement. The high-{$\beta$} equilibria usually showed only small MHD activity. The most prominent activities are low-frequency pressure-driven modes connected with low-order rationals also expected from numerical calculations using the CAS3D code, and Alfv\'en modes driven by energetic particles from the tangential neutral beam injection. Comparison of experimentally measured frequencies and mode structures from soft-X-ray tomography with theoretical predictions also shows the improving understanding of these modes in stellarators.

  abstract = {A number of problems in physics can be reduced to the study of a measure-preserving mapping of a plane onto itself. One example is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, i.e., two coupled nonlinear oscillators. These are among the simplest deterministic systems that can have chaotic solutions. According to a theorem of Kolmogorov, Arnol'd, and Moser, these systems may also have more ordered orbits lying on curves that divide the plane. The existence of each of these orbit types depends sensitively on both the parameters of the problem, and on the initial conditions. The problem addressed in this paper is that of finding when given KAM orbits exist. The guiding hypothesis is that the disappearance of a KAM surface is associated with a sudden change from stability to instability of nearby periodic orbits. The relation between KAM surfaces and periodic orbits has been explored extensively here by the numerical computation of a particular mapping. An important part of this procedure is the introduction of two quantities, the residue and the mean residue, that permit the stability of many orbits to be estimated from the extrapolation of results obtained for a few orbits. The results are distilled into a series of assertions. These are consistent with all that is previously known, strongly supported by numerical results, and lead to a method for deciding the existence of any given KAM surface computationally. \textcopyright{} 1979 American Institute of Physics.},

The first devices of the Wendelstein line were W I-A and W I-B, both racetrack-type stellarators. In the circular l = 2 stellarator W II-A, steady-state barium plasmas were investigated and were found to be governed by collisional diffusion. In W II-B, mainly Ohmic heating was applied. The main stellarator experiment at IPP Garching is W VII-A; after a period of Ohmic heating, the first net-current-free plasma was achieved in 1980. Plasma parameters of up to Tj= 1 keV and n(0) = 1014cm-3could be reached by this method. A further heating method is ECRH, which yields maximum electron temperatures of Te {$\geq$} 2 keV. The paper describes the major results of the devices mentioned and gives a short survey of further planning. \textcopyright{} 1985 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

If the collisional mean free path exceeds the electron gyroradius, the heat conductivity is much larger along the field lines than across them, and this enhances the transport across a domain where good flux surfaces do not exist. Recognising that anisotropic heat conduction may be cast in a variational form, and by constructing increasingly sophisticated trial functions that are based on invariant and almost-invariant structures under the magnetic field-line flow, bounds are derived on this enhancement and on the temperature variation along the magnetic field. In this way, remarkably accurate approximations for the temperature can be rapidly constructed without solving the diffusion equation, even in the small perpendicular-diffusion limit when the solution for the temperature is dominated by the fractal structure the magnetic field lines.},

  abstract = {The theory of plasma confinement by non-axisymmetric magnetic fields is reviewed. Such fields are used to confine fusion plasmas in stellarators, where in contrast to tokamaks and reversed-field pinches the magnetic field generally does not possess any continuous symmetry. The discussion is focussed on magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium conditions, collisionless particle orbits, and the kinetic theory of equilbrium and transport. Each of these topics is fundamentally affected by the absence of symmetry in the magnetic field: the field lines need not trace out nested flux surfaces, the particle orbits may not be confined, and the cross-field transport can be very large. Nevertheless, by tailoring the magnetic field appropriately, well-behaved equilibria with good confinement can be constructed, potentially offering an attractive route to magnetic fusion. In this article, the mathematical apparatus to describe stellarator plasmas is developed from first principles and basic elements underlying confinement optimization are introduced.},

Four distinct categories of stellarator optimization, two of which are novel approaches, are the fixed-boundary optimization, the generalized fixed-boundary optimization, the quasi-free-boundary optimization, and the free-boundary (coil) optimization. These are described using the MRxMHD energy functional, the Biot\textendash Savart integral, the coil-penalty functional and the virtual casing integral and their derivatives. The proposed free-boundary equilibrium calculation differs from existing methods in how the boundary-value problem is posed, and for the new approach it seems that there is not an associated energy minimization principle because a non-symmetric functional arises. We propose to solve the weak formulation of this problem using a spectral-Galerkin method, and this will reduce the free-boundary equilibrium calculation to something comparable to a fixed-boundary calculation. In our discussion of combined plasma\textendash coil optimization algorithms, we emphasize the importance of the stability matrix.},

  abstract = {Wendelstein 7-AS was the first modular stellarator device to test some basic elements of stellarator optimization: a reduced Shafranov shift and improved stability properties resulted in {$\beta$}-values up to 3.4\% (at 0.9 T). This operational limit was determined by power balance and impurity radiation without noticeable degradation of stability or a violent collapse. The partial reduction of neoclassical transport could be verified in agreement with calculations indicating the feasibility of the concept of drift optimization. A full neoclassical optimization, in particular a minimization of the bootstrap current was beyond the scope of this project. A variety of non-ohmic heating and current drive scenarios by ICRH, NBI and in particular, ECRH were tested and compared successfully with their theoretical predictions. Besides, new heating schemes of overdense plasmas were developed such as RF mode conversion heating\textemdash Ordinary mode, Extraordinary mode, Bernstein-wave (OXB) heating\textemdash or 2nd harmonic O-mode (O2) heating. The energy confinement was about a factor of 2 above ISS95 without degradation near operational boundaries. A number of improved confinement regimes such as core electron-root confinement with central T e {$\leq$} 7 keV and regimes with strongly sheared radial electric field at the plasma edge resulting in T i {$\leq$} 1.7 keV were obtained. As the first non-tokamak device, W7-AS achieved the H-mode and moreover developed a high density H-mode regime (HDH) with strongly reduced impurity confinement that allowed quasi-steady-state operation ({$\tau$} {$\approx$} 65 {$\cdot$} {$\tau$} E ) at densities \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/50/5/053001/ppcf224941in001.gif] \{\textbackslash bar \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash rme\} \textbackslash cong 4 \textbackslash times 10\^\{20\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash mbox\{m\}\^\{-3\}\} (at 2.5 T).

The behavior of electron transport is found to be the same over a wide range of energies but the behavior of ion transport for low-energy ions is found to be different than that for high-energy ions. Furthermore, the electron fluxes do not vary with the change in the radial ambipolar electric field nearly as much as do the ion fluxes. Thus the particle diffusion is controlled by the electrons. A nonradial ambipolar electric field is induced by ion drift. This electric field enhances the transport by about 15\%\textendash 20\%. A convenient graphical method that allows one to determine the magnitude of the radial ambipolar field for machines with different parameters is presented. Numerical examples show that electron energy confinement time is comparable to the ion energy confinement time for all the different size stellarators studied. Although the neoclassical losses are large, it is shown that ignition can be achieved in a reasonably sized stellarator reactor. Finally, fron the standpoint of reactor economics, the confinement scaling law shows that in order to increase n{$\tau$}, it is better to increase the aspect ratio than the overall dimensions of the reactor.},

  abstract = {We develop a multiple interface variational model, comprising multiple Taylor-relaxed plasma regions separated by ideal MHD barriers. The magnetic field in each region is Beltrami, {$\nabla$} \{\textbackslash times\} B = {$\mu$} B , and the pressure constant. Between regions the pressure, field strength, and rotational transform may have step changes at the ideal barrier. A principle motivation is the development of a mathematically rigorous ideal MHD model to describe intrinsically 3D equilibria, with nonzero internal pressure, using robust KAM surfaces as the barriers. This article chiefly addresses whether the stability of two interface configurations with continuous rotational transform, but vanishing interface separation, is different from the stability of a single interface configuration with jump in the rotational transform. To make the problem analytically tractable, we derive the equilibria and stability of a multi-interface plasma in a periodic cylinder, generalizing the cylindrical treatment of Kaiser and Uecker (2004 Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 57 1--17). For two interfaces with no jump in rotational transform, we show that one eigenmode has in-phase interface displacements, and an eigenvalue that converges to the single barrier case in the limit of vanishing interface width. The complementary eigenmode is out-of-phase, and highly unstable. Physically, the unstable eigenmode is driven by the parallel current, and caused by the high shear required to match the different rotational transform on each interface. In the limit that the interface separation vanishes, the shear and parallel current density become infinite, and the parallel current between the interfaces nonzero. Surfaces with out-of-phase displacements will then collide, unless the amplitude goes to zero as the interface separation goes to zero. These results suggest the hypothesis that KAM barriers with different irrational rotational transform on either side may be allowable without violating nonlinear stability.},

The method is based upon quadratic-flux minimizing surfaces which pass directly through both the X and O points of the island chains. Using a suitable measure of island width, it is possible to utilize standard numerical optimization methods to achieve desirable configurations. A major island chain in the H-1NF heliac vacuum field has been made to both disappear and to reappear with opposite phase.

The full set of ideal-MHD constraints is applied only on a discrete set of toroidal magnetic surfaces (invariant tori), which act as barriers against leakage of magnetic flux, helicity, and pressure through chaotic field-line transport. It is argued that a necessary condition for such invariant tori to exist is that they have fixed, irrational rotational transforms. In the toroidal domains bounded by these surfaces, full Taylor relaxation is assumed, thus leading to Beltrami fields {$\nabla\lbrace\backslash$}times\vphantom\{\}B = {$\lambda$}B, where {$\lambda$} is constant within each domain. Two distinct eigenvalue problems for {$\lambda$} arise in this formulation, depending on whether fluxes and helicity are fixed, or boundary rotational transforms.

  abstract = {Analyses of plasma behavior often begin with a description of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, this being the simplest model capable of approximating macroscopic force balance. Ideal force balance is when the pressure gradient is supported by the Lorentz force, {$\nabla$}p=j\texttimes B. We discuss the implications of allowing for a chaotic magnetic field on the solutions to this equation. We argue that the solutions are pathological and not suitable for numerical calculations. If the pressure and magnetic field are continuous, the only nontrivial solutions have an uncountable infinity of discontinuities in the pressure gradient and current. The problems arise from the arbitrarily small length scales in the structure of the field, and the consequence of ideal force balance that the pressure is constant along the field-lines, B{$\nabla$}p=0. A simple method to ameliorate the singularities is to include a small but finite perpendicular diffusion. A self-consistent set of equilibrium equations is described, and some algorithmic approaches aimed at solving these equations are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {Two approaches to defining almost-invariant surfaces for magnetic fields with imperfect magnetic surfaces are compared. Both methods are based on treating magnetic field-line flow as a 1{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian) dynamical system. In the quadratic-flux minimizing surface approach, the integral of the square of the action gradient over the toroidal and poloidal angles is minimized, while in the ghost surface approach a gradient flow between a minimax and an action-minimizing orbit is used. In both cases the almost-invariant surface is constructed as a family of periodic pseudo-orbits, and consequently it has a rational rotational transform. The construction of quadratic-flux minimizing surfaces is simple, and easily implemented using a new magnetic field-line tracing method. The construction of ghost surfaces requires the representation of a pseudo field line as an (in principle) infinite-dimensional vector and also is inherently slow for systems near integrability. As a test problem the magnetic field-line Hamiltonian is constructed analytically for a topologically toroidal, non-integrable ABC-flow model, and both types of almost-invariant surface are constructed numerically.},

  abstract = {Two candidates for ``almost-invariant'' toroidal surfaces passing through magnetic islands, namely quadratic-flux-minimizing (QFMin) surfaces and ghost surfaces, use families of periodic pseudo-orbits (i.e. paths for which the action is not exactly extremal). QFMin pseudo-orbits, which are coordinate-dependent, are field lines obtained from a modified magnetic field, and ghost-surface pseudo-orbits are obtained by displacing closed field lines in the direction of steepest descent of magnetic action, {$\oint$}A{$\cdot$}dl. A generalized Hamiltonian definition of ghost surfaces is given and specialized to the usual Lagrangian definition. A modified Hamilton's Principle is introduced that allows the use of Lagrangian integration for calculation of the QFMin pseudo-orbits. Numerical calculations show QFMin and Lagrangian ghost surfaces give very similar results for a chaotic magnetic field perturbed from an integrable case, and this is explained using a perturbative construction of an auxiliary poloidal angle for which QFMin and Lagrangian ghost surfaces are the same up to second order. While presented in the context of 3-dimensional magnetic field line systems, the concepts are applicable to defining almost-invariant tori in other 112 degree-of-freedom nonintegrable Lagrangian/Hamiltonian systems.},

  abstract = {The variational principle for relaxed toroidal plasma-vacuum systems with pressure is applied to axially periodic circular cylinders. More pre- cisely, equilibria with cylindrical symmetry are investigated for their po- tential to be a relaxed state. Such equilibria are characterized by their pinch ratio \textmu, the jump {$\delta$} of the pitch angle of the magnetic field across the plasma\textendash vacuum interface, a constant plasma pressure {$\beta$}, and the ratio l of wall radius over interface radius. In the limit of an infinitely long cylinder the necessary and sufficient condition for the equilibrium to be a relaxed state defines one or two intervals of allowed values of the pinch ratio \textmu, which depend still on the other parameters. These intervals are contained in the interval known from Taylor's theory, but are generally smaller. They are shrinking with increasing plasma pressure {$\beta$} or increasing radius ratio l. In particular, in the field-free limit case {$\beta$} = 1, for l exceeding the critical value lc {$\approx$} 4.983, or for a vanishing {$\delta$}, these intervals are zero.},

Well controlled shorter hydrogen discharges at higher power (4 MW ECRH power for 1 s) and longer discharges at lower power (0.7 MW ECRH power for 6 s) could be routinely established after proper wall conditioning.

This paper reports on the results from the first high-performance plasma operation. Glow discharge conditioning and ECRH conditioning discharges in helium turned out to be important for density and edge radiation control. Plasma densities of                                                              with central electron temperatures                                                              were routinely achieved with hydrogen gas fueling, frequently terminated by a radiative collapse. In a first stage, plasma densities up to                                                              were reached with hydrogen pellet injection and helium gas fueling. Here, the ions are indirectly heated, and at a central density of                                                              a temperature of                                                              with                                                              was transiently accomplished, which corresponds to                                                              with a peak diamagnetic energy of                                                              and volume-averaged normalized plasma pressure                                                              . The routine access to high plasma densities was opened with boronization of the first wall. After boronization, the oxygen impurity content was reduced by a factor of 10, the carbon impurity content by a factor of 5. The reduced (edge) plasma radiation level gives routinely access to higher densities without radiation collapse, e.g. well above                                                              line integrated density and                                                              central temperatures at moderate ECRH power. Both X2 and O2 mode ECRH schemes were successfully applied. Core turbulence was measured with a phase contrast imaging diagnostic and suppression of turbulence during pellet injection was observed.},

The numerical solutions of the MRxMHD equilibria have been constructed using the Stepped Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC) (Hudson et al 2012 Phys. Plasmas 19 112502). In principle, SPEC could also be established to describe the MRxMHD stability of an equilibrium. In this work, a theoretical framework is developed to relate the second variation of the energy functional to the so-called Hessian matrix, enabling the prediction of MHD linear instabilities of cylindrical plasmas, and is implemented in SPEC. The negative and positive eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix predict the stability of an equilibrium. Verification studies of SPEC stability results with the M3D-C 1 code and the tearing mode {$\Delta{'}$} criterion have been conducted for ideal and resistive MHD instabilities, respectively, in a pressureless cylindrical tokamak, and have shown good agreement. Our stability analysis is a critical step towards understanding the MHD stability of three-dimensional MHDs where nested flux surfaces, magnetic islands and stochastic regions co-exist.},

A related expansion was done by Garren and Boozer ( Phys.

Our calculation in contrast does not use the Frenet\textendash Serret frame. The transformation between the Garren\textendash Boozer approach and cylindrical coordinates is derived, and the two approaches are shown to be equivalent if the axis curvature does not vanish. The expressions derived here help enable optimized plasma shapes to be constructed that can be provided as input to VMEC and other stellarator codes, or to generate initial configurations for conventional stellarator optimization.},

Previously, quasisymmetric magnetic fields have been identified by applying black-box optimization algorithms to minimize symmetry-breaking Fourier modes of the field strength . Here, instead, we directly construct magnetic fields in cylindrical coordinates that are quasisymmetric to leading order in the distance from the magnetic axis, without using optimization. The method involves solution of a one-dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equation, originally derived by Garren \& Boozer (Phys. Fluids B, vol. 3, 1991, p. 2805). We demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of this optimization-free approach by providing the results of this construction as input to the codes VMEC and BOOZ-XFORM, confirming the purity and scaling of the magnetic spectrum. The space of magnetic fields that are quasisymmetric to this order is parameterized by the magnetic axis shape along with three other real numbers, one of which reflects the on-axis toroidal current density, and another one of which is zero for stellarator symmetry. The method here could be used to generate good initial conditions for conventional optimization, and its speed enables exhaustive searches of parameter space.},

  abstract = {A method is demonstrated to optimize a stellarator's geometry to eliminate magnetic islands and achieve other desired physics properties at the same time. For many physics quantities that have been used in stellarator optimization, including quasisymmetry, neoclassical transport, and magnetohydrodynamic stability, it is convenient to use a magnetic equilibrium representation that assures the existence of magnetic surfaces. However, this representation hides the possible presence of magnetic islands, which are typically undesirable. To include both surface-based objectives and island widths in a single optimization, two fixed-boundary equilibrium calculations are run at each iteration of the optimization: one that enforces the existence of magnetic surfaces (VMEC [S. P. Hirshman and J. C. Whitson, Phys. Fluids 26, 3553 (1983)]), and one that does not (SPEC [S. R. Hudson, et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)]). By penalizing the island residues in the objective function, the two magnetic field representations are brought into agreement during the optimization. An example is presented in which, particularly on the surface where quasisymmetry was targeted, quasisymmetry is achieved more accurately than in previously published examples.},

First, neoclassical phenomena are computed for the LHD and W7-X stellarators using several versions of the drift-kinetic equation, including the commonly used incompressible-E\,\texttimes\,B-drift approximation and two other variants, corresponding to different effective particle trajectories. It is found that for electric fields below roughly one third of the resonant value, the different formulations give nearly identical results, demonstrating the incompressible E\,\texttimes\,B-drift approximation is quite accurate in this regime. However, near the electric field resonance, the models yield substantially different results. We also compare results for various collision operators, including the full linearized Fokker-Planck operator. At low collisionality, the radial transport driven by radial gradients is nearly identical for the different operators; while in other cases, it is found to be important that collisions conserve momentum.},

The approach is based on the fact that all neoclassical phenomena in quasi-symmetry are isomorphic to those in axisymmetry. Therefore, accurate formulas for the bootstrap current in tokamaks, which can be evaluated rapidly, can be applied also in stellarators. The deviation between this predicted parallel current and the actual parallel current in the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium is penalized in the objective function, and the current profile of the equilibrium is included in the parameter space. Quasi-symmetric configurations with significant pressure are thereby obtained with self-consistent bootstrap current and excellent confinement. In a comparison of fusion-produced alpha particle confinement across many stellarators, the new configurations have significantly lower alpha energy losses than many previous designs.},

The second is a surface integral over a surface current on the equilibrium boundary.

Plasmas, vol. 19 (11), 2012) is used in order to assess whether or not magnetic islands and stochastic field-lines can emerge at high {$\beta$}. Two modes of operation are considered: a zero-net-current stellarator and a fixed-iota stellarator. Despite the fact that relaxation is allowed (Taylor, Rev. Mod. Phys., vol. 58 (3), 1986, pp. 741-763), the former is shown to maintain good flux surfaces up to the equilibrium {$\beta$}-limit predicted by ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), above which a separatrix forms. The latter, which has no ideal equilibrium {$\beta$}-limit, is shown to develop regions of magnetic islands and chaos at sufficiently high {$\beta$}, thereby providing a 'non-ideal {$\beta$}-limit'. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the value of {$\beta$} at which the Shafranov shift of the axis reaches a fraction of the minor radius follows in all cases the scaling laws predicted by ideal-MHD. We compare our results to the High-Beta-Stellarator theory of Freidberg (Ideal MHD, 2014, Cambridge University Press) and derive a new prediction for the non-ideal equilibrium {$\beta$}-limit above which chaos emerges.},

  abstract = {(abridged) Magnetic reconnection is the topological reconfiguration of the magnetic field in a plasma, accompanied by the violent release of energy and particle acceleration. Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves, with solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years, the theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid systems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of reconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated the field for \textasciitilde 50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent, bursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation and ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model reconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm is that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the Lundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual shift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently unstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current sheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first place. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent reconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper provides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in reconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework. We briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected applications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at the frontier of this subject. Amongst these are the analytical and numerical extension of the plasmoid instability to (i) 3D and (ii) non-MHD regimes. New results are reported in both cases.},

The characteristics of this equation obey Hamiltonian equations of motion, and a necessary condition for the existence of a continued field across a general toroidal surface is that there exist invariant tori in the phase space of this Hamiltonian system. It is argued from the Birkhoff theorem that existence of such an invariant torus is also, in general, sufficient for continuation to be possible. An important corollary is that the rotational transform of the continued field on a surface of discontinuity must, generically, be irrational. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The orientation of the winding pack is parametrized with a Fourier series and can be optimized as well. Optimized finite-build coils for a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)-like stellarator are found, and compared with filamentary coil results.

Twist maps correspond to Hamiltonians for which the velocity is a monotonic function of the canonical momentum. Twist maps have a Lagrangian variational formulation. One-parameter families of twist maps typically exhibit the full range of possible dynamics-from simple or integrable motion to complex or chaotic motion. One class of orbits, the minimizing orbits, can be found throughout this transition; the properties of the minimizing orbits are discussed in detail. Among these orbits are the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits, which form a scaffold in the phase space and constrain the motion of the remaining orbits. The theory of transport deals with the motion of ensembles of trajectories. The variational principle provides an efficient technique for computing the Aux escaping from regions bounded by partial barriers formed from minimizing orbits. Unsolved problems in the theory of transport include the explanation for algebraic tails in correlation functions, and its extension to maps of more than two dimensions.},

Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) describes how plasma pressure, current density and magnetic field interact. In a stellarator, the confining field is three-dimensional, and the computational cost of solving the 3D MHD equations currently limits stellarator comprehension, exploration and optimization. Although data-driven approaches have been proposed to provide fast 3D MHD equilibria, the accuracy with which equilibrium properties are reconstructed is unknown. In this work, we describe an artificial neural network (NN) that quickly approximates the ideal-MHD solution operator in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) configurations. This model fulfils equilibrium symmetries by construction. The MHD force residual regularizes the solution of the NN to satisfy the ideal-MHD equations. The model predicts the equilibrium solution with high accuracy, and it faithfully reconstructs global equilibrium quantities and proxy functions used in stellarator optimization. The regularization term enforces that the NN reduces the ideal-MHD force residual, and solutions that are better than ground truth equilibria can be obtained at inference time. We also optimize W7-X magnetic configurations, where competitive configurations can be found in terms of fast particle confinement. This work demonstrates with which accuracy NN models can approximate the 3D ideal-MHD solution operator and reconstruct equilibrium properties of interest, and it suggests how they might be used to optimize stellarator magnetic configurations.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to calculate dose distributions from CyberKnife image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for brain, H\&N, lung, and pelvis treatment regions and use them to extract the corresponding effective dose and estimate-related risk. Methods: We developed a CyberKnife IGRT kV beam model in a standard treatment planning system and validated it against measurements in heterogeneous phantoms. Five brain, five head and neck, five thorax, and 10 (five male and five female) pelvis patient computed tomographies (CTs) were contoured. The dose distribution resulting from different CyberKnife IGRT protocols was calculated. From them, the effective dose was calculated according to ICRP publication Nr 103, using the average dose to contoured organs. The corresponding risk factors were calculated. Entrance surface dose (ESD) was also calculated and compared with existing data. Results: The maximum effective dose produced by CyberKnife IGRT protocols was 0.8~mSv (brain), 1.9~mSv (H\&N), 20.2 (pelvis), and 42.4~mSv (thorax) per fraction for a risk estimate of 0.004\% (brain), 0.01\% (H\&N), 0.1\% (pelvis), and 0.2\% (thorax). Calculated ESD were compatible with existing data. Conclusions: Dose calculation models for CyberKnife IGRT kV beams were implemented in a clinical treatment planning system and validated in water and heterogeneous phantoms. We determined the effective dose and the related risk estimate resulting from CyberKnife IGRT protocols for brain, head and neck, thorax, and pelvis cases. The effective doses calculated for CyberKnife IGRT protocols were similar to those obtained for cone beam CT protocols on conventional C-arm linear accelerators, except for extreme irradiation conditions for thorax cases (140~kV X-ray tube tension).},

The world's largest science project and biggest ever fusion reactor, ITER, is nearing completion. Its success could trigger a worldwide race to build a power plant, but failure could delay fusion by decades.

  abstract = {Given the large anisotropy of transport processes in magnetized plasmas, the magnetic field structure can strongly impact heat diffusion: magnetic surfaces and cantori form barriers to transport while chaotic layers and island structures can degrade confinement. When a small but non-zero amount of perpendicular diffusion is included, the structure of the magnetic field becomes less important, allowing pressure gradients to be supported across chaotic regions and island chains. We introduce a metric for the effective volume over which the local parallel diffusion dominates based on the solution to the anisotropic heat diffusion equation. To validate this metric, we consider model fields with a single island chain and a strongly chaotic layer for which analytic predictions of the relative parallel and perpendicular transport can be made. We also analyse critically chaotic fields produced from different sets of perturbations, highlighting the impact of the mode number spectrum on the heat transport. Our results indicate that this metric coincides with the effective volume of non-integrability in the limit {$\kappa\perp$} \textrightarrow{} 0, where {$\kappa\perp$} is the perpendicular diffusion coefficient. We propose that this metric be used to assess the impact of non-integrability on the heat transport in stellarator equilibria.},

The largest and most sophisticated stellarator in the world, Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), has just started operation, with the aim to show that the earlier weaknesses of this concept have been addressed successfully, and that the intrinsic advantages of the concept persist, also at plasma parameters approaching those of a future fusion power plant. Here we show the first physics results, obtained before plasma operation: that the carefully tailored topology of nested magnetic surfaces needed for good confinement is realized, and that the measured deviations are smaller than one part in 100,000. This is a significant step forward in stellarator research, since it shows that the complicated and delicate magnetic topology can be created and verified with the required accuracy.},

Plasmas 18, 062504 (2011)] is a recently developed MHD equilibrium code designed to perform fast and accurate calculations of ideal MHD equilibria for three-dimensional magnetic configurations. Since SIESTA does not assume closed magnetic surfaces, the solution can exhibit magnetic islands and stochastic regions. In its original implementation SIESTA addressed only fixed-boundary problems. That is, the shape of the plasma edge, assumed to be a magnetic surface, was kept fixed as the solution iteratively converges to equilibrium. This condition somewhat restricts the possible applications of SIESTA. In this paper, we discuss an extension that will enable SIESTA to address free-plasma-boundary problems, opening up the possibility of investigating problems in which the plasma boundary is perturbed either externally or internally. As an illustration, SIESTA is applied to a configuration of the W7-X stellarator.},

Bootstrap currents in the range of tens of kAs can lead to the formation of unwanted magnetic island chains or stochastic regions within the plasma and alter the boundary rotational transform due to the small shear in W7-X. The latter issue is of relevance since the island divertor operation of W7-X relies on a proper positioning of magnetic island chains at the plasma edge to control the particle and energy exhaust towards the divertor plates. Two scenarios are examined with the new free-plasma-boundary capabilities of SIESTA: a freely evolving bootstrap current one that illustrates the difficulties arising from the dislocation of the boundary islands, and a second one in which off-axis electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) is applied to compensate the effects  of the bootstrap current and keep the island divertor configuration intact. SIESTA finds that off-axis ECCD is indeed able to keep the location and phase of the edge magnetic island chain unchanged, but it may also lead to an undesired stochastization of parts of the confined plasma if the EC deposition radial profile becomes too narrow.},

This interpolation method exactly preserves the order of the RK4 integrating scheme which is crucial for the investigation of fast particle trajectories in 3D magnetic structures such as helical saturated tokamak plasma states, stellarator geometry and resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). The initialisation of particles with respect to the guiding-centre is discussed.

  abstract = {In the following theoretical and numerically oriented work, a number of findings have been assembled. The newly devised VENUS-LEVIS code, designed to accurately solve the motion of energetic particles in the presence of 3D magnetic fields, relies on a non-canonical general coordinate Lagrangian formulation of the guiding-centre and full-orbit equations of motion. VENUS-LEVIS can switch between guiding-centre and full-orbit equations with minimal discrepancy at first order in Larmor radius by verifying the perpendicular variation of magnetic vector field, not only including gradients and curvature terms but also parallel currents and the shearing of field-lines. By virtue of a Fourier representation of the fields in poloidal and toroidal coordinates and a cubic spline in the radial variable, the order of the Runge-Kutta integrating scheme is preserved and convergence of Hamiltonian properties is obtained. This interpolation scheme is crucial to compute orbits over slowing-down times, as well as to mitigate the singularity of the magnetic axis in toroidal flux coordinate systems. Three-dimensional saturated MHD states are associated with many tokamak phenomena including snakes and LLMs in spherical or more conventional tokamaks, and are inherent to stellarator devices. The VMEC equilibrium code conveniently reproduces such 3D magnetic configurations. Slowing-down simulations of energetic ions from NBI predict off-axis deposition of particles during LLM MHD activity in hybrid-like plasmas of the MAST. Co-passing particles helically align in the opposite side of the plasma deformation, whereas counter-passing and trapped particles are less affected by the presence of a helical core. Qualitative agreement is found against experimental measurements of the neutron emission. Two opposing approaches to include RMPs in fast ion simulations are compared, one where the vacuum field caused by the RMP current coils is added to the axisymmetric MHD equilibrium, the other where the MHD equilibrium includes the plasma response within the 3D deformation of its flux-surfaces. The first model admits large regions of stochastic field-lines that penetrate the plasma without alteration. The second assumes nested flux-surfaces with a single magnetic axis, embedding the RMPs in a 3D saturated ideal MHD state but excluding stochastic field-lines within the last closed flux-surface. Simulations of fast ion populations from NBI are applied to MAST n=3 RMP coil configuration with 4 different activation patterns. At low beam energies, particle losses are dominated by parallel transport due to the stochasticity of the field-lines, whereas at higher energies, losses are accredited to the 3D structure of the perturbed plasma as well as drift resonances},

Plasmas 19 112502) requires a fast and robust solver to obtain the Beltrami field in three-dimensional geometry such as stellarators. The spectral method implemented in the stepped pressure equilibrium code (SPEC) is efficient when the domain is a hollow torus, but ill-conditioning of the discretised linear equations occurs in the (solid) toroid due to the artificially singular coordinate parameterisation near the axis. In this work, we propose an improved choice for the reference axis to prevent coordinates surfaces from overlapping. Then, we examine the parity and asymptotics of the magnetic vector potential near the axis and suggest the use of recombined and rescaled Zernike radial basis functions. The maximum relative error in the magnetic field of the Wendelstein 7-X geometry is shown to reach 10-9 at high resolution in a series of convergence tests and benchmarks against the boundary integral equation solver for Taylor states. The new method is also reported to significantly improve the accuracy of multi-volume SPEC calculations. A comparison between free-boundary SPEC and the analytical Dommaschk potential is presented with higher-than-usual Fourier resolution. It is illustrated that we are able to resolve low amplitude current sheets when an interface is placed where there is no flux surface in the analytic solution.

In this model, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes separated by ideal interfaces, and in each volume the magnetic field is a Beltrami field. In the cases where the system is far from possessing a continuous symmetry, such as in stellarators, the existence of solutions to a stepped-pressure equilibrium with given constraints, such as a multi-region relaxed MHD minimum energy state, is not guaranteed but is often taken for granted. Using SPEC, we have studied two different scenarios in which a solution fails to exist in a slab with analytic boundary perturbations. We found that with a large boundary perturbation, a certain interface becomes fractal, corresponding to the break up of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surface. Moreover, an interface can only support a maximum pressure jump while a solution of the magnetic field consistent with the force balance condition can be found. An interface closer to break-up can support a smaller pressure jump. We discovered that the pressure jump can push the interface closer to being non-smooth through force balance, thus significantly decreasing the maximum pressure it can support. Our work shows that a convergence study must be performed on a SPEC equilibrium with interfaces close to break-up. These results may also provide insights into the choice of interfaces and have applications in finding out the maximum pressure a machine can support.},

In MRxMHD, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes separated by ideal interfaces, each undergoing relaxation, allowing the formation of islands and chaos. The resulting equilibrium has a stepped pressure profile across sub-volumes. The stepped pressure equilibrium code (SPEC) (S R Hudson et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)) was developed to calculate MRxMHD equilibria numerically. In this work, we have extended the SPEC code to compute MRxMHD equilibria with field-aligned flow and rotation, following the theoretical development to incorporate cross-helicity and angular momentum constraints. The code has been verified for convergence and compared to a Grad\textendash Shafranov solver in 2D. We apply our new tool to study the flow profile change before and after the sawtooth crash of a reversed-field pinch discharge, in which data of the parallel flow is available. We find the promising result that under the constraints of cross-helicity and angular momentum, the parallel flow profile in post-crash SPEC equilibrium is flat in the plasma core and the amplitude of the flow matches experimental observations. Finally, we provide an example equilibrium with a 3D helical field structure as the favoured lower energy state. This will be the first 3D numerical equilibrium in which the flow effects are self-consistently calculated.},

  abstract = {A new set of analytical formulae for calculating the bootstrap current and the neoclassical conductivity in tokamak experiments is presented. Previous works comparing the widely used Sauter model with results of recently developed numerical neoclassical solvers have shown the Sauter model to be inaccurate at higher collisionalities typical of tokamak edge pedestals and in the presence of impurities. Thus, its applicability, particularly for the analysis of the highly interesting and highly complex plasma edge, is limited. For a revised set of analytical formulae, the procedure to determine the analytical formulae described by Sauter is repeated with the more accurate and more reliable numerical code NEO [E. Belli, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 54, 015015 (2012)]. For the determination of the respective bootstrap current coefficient, the linearity of neoclassical transport is exploited. This new set of analytical formulae consists of the same analytical structure as the original set of analytical formulae published by Sauter [Phys. Plasmas 6, 2834 (1999); ibid. 9, 5140 (2002)] and also continues to use only three neoclassical key parameters: the fraction of trapped particles f trap, the collisionality {$\nu$} {$\sigma$}*, and the effective charge number Z eff.},

The source of that disagreement has been investigated, and that investigation has led to new insights into the domain of validity of the different equilibrium calculations, and to a finding that the manner in which localized screening currents at low order rational surfaces are handled can affect global properties of the equilibrium solution. The perturbative treatment has been found to break down at surprisingly small perturbation amplitudes due to overlap of the calculated perturbed flux surfaces, and that treatment is not valid in the pedestal region of the DIII-D shot studied. The perturbative treatment is valid, however, further into the interior of the plasma, and flux surface overlap does not account for the disagreement investigated here. Calculated equilibrium solutions for simple model cases and comparison of the 3D equilibrium solutions with those of other codes indicate that the disagreement arises from a difference in handling of localized currents at low order rational surfaces, with such currents being absent in VMEC and present in the perturbative codes. The significant differences in the global equilibrium solutions associated with the presence or absence of very localized screening currents at rational surfaces suggests that it may be possible to extract information about localized currents from appropriate measurements of global equilibrium plasma properties. That would require improved diagnostic capability on the high field side of the tokamak plasma, a region difficult to access with diagnostics.},

Both the Wendelstein 7-AS and large helical device stellarators had dedicated experimental campaigns to study the {$\beta$} limit in those devices.

This beta value was instantaneously obtained by pellet injection and maintained for more than 10{$\tau$}E, whereas the steady-state plasma with a maximum {$\langle\beta$}dia{$\rangle$} of 4.8\% was sustained for 85{$\tau$}E by gas-puff fueling. While it is theoretically predicted that stochastization of the peripheral magnetic field structure develops with an increment of {$\langle\beta$}dia{$\rangle$}, no serious degradation of the global confinement has been observed in the present {$\langle\beta$} dia{$\rangle$} range. The several low-order MHD activities located in the periphery were enhanced with the beta value and sometimes affect the local profiles. The amplitude of the mode in the periphery strongly depends on the magnetic Reynolds number, which is close to that of the growth rate and/or the radial mode width of the resistive interchange instability. \textcopyright{} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The three conditions correspond to 50 kW input power with a resonance that is off-axis, 50 kW on-axis heating and 100 kW on-axis heating. When the heating location was moved from off-axis to on-axis with 50 kW heating power, the stored energy and the extrapolated steady-state current were both observed to increase. When the on-axis heating power was increased from 50 kW to 100 kW, the stored energy continued to increase while the bootstrap current slightly decreased. This trend is qualitatively in agreement with the calculations which indicate that a large positive electric field for the 100 kW case was driving the current negative in a small region close to the magnetic axis and accounting for the decrease in the total integrated current. This trend in the calculations is only observed to occur when momentum conservation between particle species is included. Without momentum conservation, the calculated bootstrap current increases monotonically. We show that the magnitude of the bootstrap current as calculated by PENTA agrees better with the experiment when momentum conservation between plasma species is included in the calculation. The total current was observed in all cases to flow in a direction to unwind the transform, unlike in a tokamak in which the bootstrap current adds to the transform. The 3-D inductive response of the plasma is simulated to predict the evolution of the current profile during the discharge. The 3-D equilibrium reconstruction code V3FIT is used to reconstruct profiles of the plasma pressure and current constrained by measurements with a set of magnetic diagnostics. The reconstructed profiles are consistent with the measured plasma pressure profile and the simulated current profile when the reconstruction is constrained by the measured data from a diagnostic array that is internal to the vacuum chamber.},

Only in quasi-symmetric fields, where collisional particle transport is intrinsically ambipolar, can the plasma rotate freely and then only in the quasi-symmetry direction. Sonic rotation velocities are allowed in this case. In this paper the effect of rotation in a quasi-axisymmetric field is investigated, and it is found that the symmetry is broken when the rotation speed exceeds the diamagnetic speed appreciably, leading to reappearance of the non-intrinsically ambipolar 1/{$\nu$}-transport regime. Fortunately, this transport scales with the fourth power of the rotation Mach number and is expected to be modest in most plasmas of interest.},

ARC is a {$\sim$}200-250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q{$<$}inf{$>$}p{$<$}/inf{$>$} {$\approx$} 13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only {$\sim$}63\%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the {$\sim$}23 T peak field on coil achievable with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio {$\geq$} 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits an output blanket temperature of 900 K, single phase fluid cooling, and a high efficiency helium Brayton cycle, which allows for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.},

In the extended variational problem, one prescribes, in addition to the helicity and the magnetic fluxes whose conservation follows from the perfect conductivity of the wall, the fluxes whose conservation follows from the assumption that the plasma-vacuum interface is also perfectly conducting (if the wall is a magnetic surface, then one has the toroidal and the poloidal flux in the vacuum). Vanishing of the first energy variation implies a pressureless free-boundary magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with a Beltrami magnetic field in the plasma, and in general with a surface current in the interface. Positivity of the second variation implies that the equilibrium is stable according to ideal magnetohydrodynamics, that it is a relaxed state according to Taylor's theory if the interface is replaced by a wall, and that the surface current is nonzero (at least if there are no closed magnetic field lines in the interface). The plane slab, with suitable boundary conditions to simulate a genuine torus, is investigated in detail. The relaxed state has the same double symmetry as the vessel if, and only if, the prescribed helicity is in an interval that depends on the prescribed fluxes.

  abstract = {A moments method approach for stellarator transport is developed and applied to devices embodying the three forms (quasihelical, quasitoroidal, and quasipoloidal) of stellarator quasisymmetry. Plasma parameter regimes are considered that lead both to stable electron and ion ambipolar electric field roots. The predicted flux surface averaged plasma flow velocity components and their two-dimensional variation within a flux surface are calculated and they approximately reflect the underlying symmetries in the magnetic field structure. Comparison of the shearing rates of the flows with linear stability growth rates for the ion temperature gradient mode indicates that shearing rates (driven by ambipolar transport) can be comparable to growth rates even in the absence of external flow drive.},

The edge magnetic structure in the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7X (W7-X) stellarators has been shown to have a significant impact on the particle fueling and exhaust of the plasma main species (hydrogen) as well as impurity helium. For HSX, the plasma sourcing to exhaust ratio, quantified by the effective and global particle confinement times s \~A p and s p;H , respectively, increases when a magnetic island chain is located in the plasma edge. The fueling efficiency is reduced by 25\% when the plasma boundary is deformed by the magnetic islands. The X-point geometry also yields higher plasma temperatures in front of the main recycling region. When the island is moved radially inward, both s \~A p and s p decrease by 10\%-25\% depending on plasma density. The s p;H results rely heavily on EMC3-EIRENE modeling which confirms reduced fueling efficiency due to more rapid ionization in the outward shifted island position. These findings suggest that for a helically optimized system like HSX, the plasma fueling from the recycling source, as well as from active gas injection, can be controlled by the magnetic island chain in the plasma edge-which is a basic requirement for a divertor system. This process is also effective for the control of effective helium exhaust times, as s \~A p;He measured by perturbative gas puff experiments is reduced by up to 40\% when the islands are shifted inwards. For Wendelstein 7-X, a similar reduction of s \~A p;He was inferred when magnetic islands were moved from the far plasma edge into the confined plasma region. However, the effective confinement features of H as the main plasma species were not affected due to the non-optimal position of the magnetic islands with respect to the highly localized ionization domain during the limiter startup campaign.

The plasma is robust with respect to variations of pressure and the resulting bootstrap current, which leave the bounding flux surface approximately unchanged and thus reduce active positional control requirements. This configuration was developed by reconfiguring the QPS modular coils and applying a new computational method that maximizes the volume of good (integrable) vacuum flux surfaces as a measure of robustness. The stellarator plasma and coil design code STELLOPT is used to vary the coil geometry to determine the plasma geometry and profiles that optimize plasma performance with respect to neoclassical transport, infinite-n ballooning stability up to {$<\beta>$} = 2\%, and coil engineering parameters. The normal component of the vacuum magnetic field is simultaneously minimized at the full-beta plasma boundary.},

Consequently there are several different types of relaxed state, each with its own special characteristics, which are derived and discussed.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {This paper is a summary of some of the major results from the Wendelstein 7-AS stellarator (W7-AS). W7-AS [G. Grieger, Phys. Fluids B 4, 2081 (1992)] has demonstrated the feasibility of modular coils and has pioneered the island divertor and the modeling of its three-dimensional characteristics with the EMC3/EIRENE code [Y. Feng, F. Sardei, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 44, 611 (2002)]. It has extended the operational range to high density (4\texttimes{} 1020 m-3 at 2.5 T) and high {$\langleB\rangle$} (3.4\% at 0.9 T); it has demonstrated successfully the application of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) beyond cutoff via electron Bernstein wave heating, and it has utilized the toroidal variation of the magnetic field strength for ion cyclotron resonance frequency beach-wave heating. In preparation of W7-X [J. N\"uhrenberg, Trans. Fusion Technol. 27, 71 (1995)], aspects of the optimization concept of the magnetic design have been successfully tested. W7-AS has accessed the H-mode, the first time in a "non-tokamak" and has extended H-mode operation toward high density by the discovery of the high-density H-mode (HDH), characterized by H-mode energy and L-mode-level impurity confinement. In the HDH-mode quasisteady state operation is possible close to operational limits without noticeable degradation in the plasma properties. High- {$B$} phases up to tpulse {$\tau$}E =65 have been achieved, which can already be taken as an indication of the intrinsic stellarator capability of steady-state operation. Confinement issues will be discussed with emphasis on the similarities to tokamak confinement (general transport properties, H-mode transition physics) but also with respect to distinct differences (no confinement degradation toward operational boundaries, positive density scaling, lack of profile resilience, no distinct isotope effect, H-mode operational window). W7-AS turned out to be an important step in the development of the Wendelstein stellarator line towards an independent fusion power plant concept. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {This work examines bootstrap current in quasi-symmetric stellarators with a focus on the impact of boot-strap current on the equilibrium properties of stellarator configurations. In the design of the Quasi-Poloidal Stellarator (QPS), a code was used to predict the bootstrap current based on a calculation in an asymptotically collisionless limit. This calculation is believed to be a good approximation of the bootstrap current for low-collisionality plasmas but is expected to be higher than the actual bootstrap current for more collisional plasmas. A fluid moments approach has been developed to self-consistently calculate viscosities and neoclassical transport coefficients. The viscosities and transport coefficients can be used to calculate the bootstrap current for arbitrary collisionality and magnetic geometry. The bootstrap current calculations from the two codes were done for low-density, electron cyclotron-heated (ECH) plasmas and high-density, ion cyclotron-heated (ICH) plasmas for a range of configurations, and provide a benchmark for the moments code and a test of the range of validity of the collisionless code. In the configurations examined here, namely, QPS, the National Compact Stellarator Experiment, the Helically Symmetric Experiment, the Large Helical Device, and the Wendelstein-7X Stellarator, the bootstrap currents predicted from the two codes agree qualitatively for both ICH and ECH profiles.},

  abstract = {The effect of bootstrap current on the beta limit of MHD equilibria is studied systematically by an iterative calculation of MHD equilibrium and the consistent bootstrap current in high beta heliotron plasmas. The LHD machine is treated as a standard configuration heliotron with an L = 2 planar axis. The effects of vacuum magnetic configurations, pressure profiles and the vertical field control method are studied. The equilibrium beta limit with consistent bootstrap current is quite sensitive to the magnetic axis location for finite beta, compared with the currentless cases. For a vacuum configuration with the magnetic axis shifted inwards in the torus, even in the high beta regimes, the bootstrap current flows to increase the rotational transform, leading to an increase in the equilibrium beta limit. On the contrary, for a vacuum configuration with the magnetic axis shifted outwards in the torus, even in the low beta regimes, the bootstrap current flows so as to reduce the rotational transform; therefore, there is an acceleration of the Shafranov shift increase as beta increases, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium beta limit. The pressure profiles and vertical field control methods influence the equilibrium beta limit through the location of the magnetic axis for finite beta. These characteristics are independent of both device parameters, such as magnetic field strength, and device size in the low collisional regime.},

The two effects of the finite beta on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) configuration, the magnetic surface torus outward shift and the invasion of the stochastic region into the plasma core, are discussed. The former is qualitatively the same as that by the external vertical field control. According to the comparison between a theoretical prediction in the finite beta and the vacuum field calculation in the vertical field control, the latter effect is strongly affected by the nonaxisymmetric component of the equilibrium current. A theoretical prediction suggests that an MHD equilibrium beta limit different from the conventional one exists due to the lack of the equilibrium force balance in the stochastic region. The key parameters to improve the accuracy of the identification of the MHD equilibrium configuration are shown to be the identification of the toroidal current profile, the anisotropic pressure effect, and the identification of the plasma boundary shape.},

The system of equations is used to study the possibility of non-symmetric equilibria in a topological torus, here an approximate rectangular parallelopiped, with periodicity in two of the three rectangular coordinates. An expansion is carried out in the deviation of pressure surfaces from planes. Resonances are manifest in the process. Nonetheless, provided the magnetic shear is small, it is shown that it is possible to select the magnetic fields and flux surfaces in such a manner that no singularities appear on resonant surfaces. One boundary surface of the parallelopiped is not arbitrary but is dependent on the equilibrium in question. A comparison of the solution sets of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric equilibria suggests that the latter have a wider class of possible boundary shapes but more restrictive rotational transform profiles. No proof of convergence of the series is given. \textcopyright{} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The main features of advanced stellarators are the optimized coil system which can be extrapolated to reactor size, improved properties of plasma equilibrium with reduced Shafranov shift and a stability limit which is sufficient to meet the requirements of a commercial fusion reactor. The key element to achieve these goals is the proper shape of the magnetic surfaces and minimization of the geodesic curvature of magnetic field lines. As a consequence, Pfirsch-Schl\"uter currents and radial particle transport are reduced. Neoclassical transport becomes small enough so that ignition is not endangered. The theoretical basis of the advanced stellarator is a systematic procedure to compute plasma equilibria with reduced Pfirsch-Schl\"uter currents. The close relation between neoclassical transport and viscous damping indicates that a reduction of geodesic curvature not only reduces radial transport but also leads to a reduction of viscous damping, and thus, facilitates the rotational spin-up of the plasma. For this reason achievement of shear flow and reduced anomalous transport may be expected in advanced stellarators. The paper discusses the various aspects of advanced stellarators and describes their basic properties.},

It aims at summarizing the main results and conclusions with regard to the advantages and disadvantages in these two types of magnetic fusion devices. The comparison includes basic magnetic configurations, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, operational limits and disruptions, neoclassical and turbulent transport, confinement scaling and isotopic effects, plasma rotation, and edge and divertor physics. Finally, a concept of quasi-symmetric stellarators is briefly referred along with a comparison of future application for fusion reactors.},

To this end, we adapt a topological data analysis technique known as persistent homology for the characterization of state space projections of chaotic trajectories and periodic orbits. By comparing the shapes along a chaotic trajectory to those of the periodic orbits, state space persistence analysis quantifies the geometric similarities of chaotic trajectory segments and the periodic orbits. We demonstrate the method by applying it to the three-dimensional R\textbackslash "\{o\}ssler system and a thirty-dimensional discretization of the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky partial differential equation in \$(1+1)\$ dimensions.},

Error fields can arise from many sources, but are predominantly attributed to deviations in the coil geometry. In this paper, we introduce a Hessian matrix approach for determining error field sensitivity to coil deviations. A primary cost function used for designing stellarator coils, the surface integral of normalized normal field errors, was adopted to evaluate the deviation of the generated magnetic field from the desired magnetic field. The FOCUS code (Zhu et al 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 016008) is utilized to provide fast and accurate calculations of the Hessian. The sensitivities of error fields to coil displacements are then determined by the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. A proof-of-principle example is given on a CNT-like configuration. We anticipate that this new method could provide information to avoid dominant coil misalignments and simplify coil designs for stellarators.},

Conventional approaches assume a toroidal `winding' surface, but a poorly chosen winding surface can unnecessarily constrain the coil optimization algorithm, This article presents a new method to design coils for stellarators. Each discrete coil is represented as an arbitrary, closed, one-dimensional curve embedded in three-dimensional space. A target function to be minimized that includes both physical requirements and engineering constraints is constructed. The derivatives of the target function with respect to the parameters describing the coil geometries and currents are calculated analytically. A numerical code, named flexible optimized coils using space curves (FOCUS), has been developed. Applications to a simple stellarator configuration, W7-X and LHD vacuum fields are presented.},

A prototype permanent magnet stellarator structure, PM4Stell, has been funded to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using permanent magnets to create the shaping field of a stellarator. Permanent magnets in uniform cubes with three polarization directions will be carefully placed to generate the required magnetic field for a National Compact Stellarator eXperiment-like equilibrium together with planar toroidal field coils. Discrete magnets will be glued together and inserted into a ``post-office-box-like'' supporting structure. Electromagnetic and structural analyses have been done to validate the design. Error field correction magnets will be used to shim possible error fields. The design efforts of the prototype permanent magnet stellarator structure are discussed.},
