	abstract = {The spatial topology of magnetic field lines can be chaotic for fields generated by simple current configurations. This is illustrated for a system consisting of a circular current loop and a straight current wire. An asymmetric configuration of the current system leads to three-dimensional spatially chaotic magnetic fields. The motion of charged particles in these fields is not necessarily chaotic and exhibits intriguing dynamical properties. Particles having initial velocities closely aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field are likely to follow chaotic orbits in phase space. Other particles follow coherent and periodic orbits; these orbits being the same as in the symmetric current configuration for which the field lines are not chaotic. An important feature of particles with chaotic motion is that they undergo spatial transport across magnetic field lines. The cross-field diffusion is of interest in a variety of magnetized plasmas including laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.},

Contrary to most of recent studies, we do not make any assumption on any constant of the motion and solve numerically the cyclotron gyration using Hamiltonian formalism. We take advantage of a symplectic integrator allowing us to make long-time simulations. First considering an idealized magnetic configuration, we add a non generic perturbation corresponding to a magnetic ripple, breaking one of the invariant of the motion. Chaotic motion is then observed and opens questions about the link between chaos of magnetic field lines and chaos of particle trajectories. Second, we return to a axi-symmetric configuration and tune the safety factor (magnetic configuration) in order to recover chaotic motion. In this last setting with two constants of the motion, the presence of chaos implies that no third global constant exists, we highlight this fact by looking at variations of the first order of the magnetic moment in this chaotic setting. We are facing a mixed phase space with both regular and chaotic regions and point out the difficulties in performing a global reduction such as gyrokinetics.},

	abstract = {Symplectic maps are the discrete-time analog of Hamiltonian motion. They arise in many applications including accelerator, chemical, condensed-matter, plasma, and Quid physics. Twist maps correspond to Hamiltonians for which the velocity is a monotonic function of the canonical momentum. Twist maps have a Lagrangian variational formulation. One-parameter families of twist maps typically exhibit the full range of possible dynamics-from simple or integrable motion to complex or chaotic motion. One class of orbits, the minimizing orbits, can be found throughout this transition; the properties of the minimizing orbits are discussed in detail. Among these orbits are the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits, which form a scaffold in the phase space and constrain the motion of the remaining orbits. The theory of transport deals with the motion of ensembles of trajectories. The variational principle provides an efficient technique for computing the Aux escaping from regions bounded by partial barriers formed from minimizing orbits. Unsolved problems in the theory of transport include the explanation for algebraic tails in correlation functions, and its extension to maps of more than two dimensions.},

	abstract = {A number of problems in physics can be reduced to the study of a measure-preserving mapping of a plane onto itself. One example is a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, i.e., two coupled nonlinear oscillators. These are among the simplest deterministic systems that can have chaotic solutions. According to a theorem of Kolmogorov, Arnol'd, and Moser, these systems may also have more ordered orbits lying on curves that divide the plane. The existence of each of these orbit types depends sensitively on both the parameters of the problem, and on the initial conditions. The problem addressed in this paper is that of finding when given KAM orbits exist. The guiding hypothesis is that the disappearance of a KAM surface is associated with a sudden change from stability to instability of nearby periodic orbits. The relation between KAM surfaces and periodic orbits has been explored extensively here by the numerical computation of a particular mapping. An important part of this procedure is the introduction of two quantities, the residue and the mean residue, that permit the stability of many orbits to be estimated from the extrapolation of results obtained for a few orbits. The results are distilled into a series of assertions. These are consistent with all that is previously known, strongly supported by numerical results, and lead to a method for deciding the existence of any given KAM surface computationally. © 1979 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A fully three‐dimensional spectral code has been developed and implemented. It computes three‐dimensional equilibria using the variational approach, by minimizing the potential energy subject to appropriate constraints. A second minimization, with an additional constraint, is used to examine the stability of solutions. The magnetic field representation allows for non‐nested flux surfaces. Thus it can be used to study solutions with islands and variation of the potential energy with respect to topology changes. A spectral representation in the toroidal and poloidal angles, coupled with a special choice of collocation points in the radial direction results in greatly enhanced resolution. A fast iterative method was developed, with the number of iterations required for convergence independent of the mesh size. Residuals converge exponentially to the round‐off error, allowing the potential energy to be computed to the eight‐digit accuracy required for nonlinear stability analysis. A small amount of artificial viscosity may be needed for convergence in cases where low‐order resonances are present in the plasma region. Numerical results show convergence to known axially symmetric equilibrium solutions, as well as close agreement with eigenvalue calculations in helically symmetric stellarator configurations. Solutions exhibiting island formations are found to have lower potential energy than that of the nearby nested case. Internal modes are found to localize inside the resonant surface, with the eigenfunction having sharp gradients at the resonant surface. Copyright © 1988 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

Ideal force balance is when the pressure gradient is supported by the Lorentz force, ∇p=j×B. We discuss the implications of allowing for a chaotic magnetic field on the solutions to this equation. We argue that the solutions are pathological and not suitable for numerical calculations. If the pressure and magnetic field are continuous, the only nontrivial solutions have an uncountable infinity of discontinuities in the pressure gradient and current. The problems arise from the arbitrarily small length scales in the structure of the field, and the consequence of ideal force balance that the pressure is constant along the field-lines, B∇p=0. A simple method to ameliorate the singularities is to include a small but finite perpendicular diffusion. A self-consistent set of equilibrium equations is described, and some algorithmic approaches aimed at solving these equations are discussed. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

For many physics quantities that have been used in stellarator optimization, including quasisymmetry, neoclassical transport, and magnetohydrodynamic stability, it is convenient to use a magnetic equilibrium representation that assures the existence of magnetic surfaces. However, this representation hides the possible presence of magnetic islands, which are typically undesirable. To include both surface-based objectives and island widths in a single optimization, two fixed-boundary equilibrium calculations are run at each iteration of the optimization: one that enforces the existence of magnetic surfaces (VMEC [S. P. Hirshman and J. C. Whitson, Phys. Fluids 26, 3553 (1983)]), and one that does not (SPEC [S. R. Hudson, et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)]). By penalizing the island residues in the objective function, the two magnetic field representations are brought into agreement during the optimization. An example is presented in which, particularly on the surface where quasisymmetry was targeted, quasisymmetry is achieved more accurately than in previously published examples.},

Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)] could be optimized for good magnetic surfaces in vacuum. In this paper, we build upon their work to show the first finite- β, fixed-, and free-boundary optimization of SPEC equilibria for good magnetic surfaces. The objective function is constructed with the Greene's residue of selected rational surfaces, and the optimization is driven by the SIMSOPT framework [Landreman et al., J. Open Source Software 6, 3525 (2021)]. We show that the size of magnetic islands and the consequent regions occupied by chaotic field lines can be minimized in a classical stellarator geometry (rotating ellipse) by optimizing either the injected toroidal current profile, the shape of a perfectly conducting wall surrounding the plasma (fixed-boundary case), or the vacuum field produced by the coils (free-boundary case). This work shows that SPEC can be used as an equilibrium code both in a two-step or single-step stellarator optimization loop.},

The system of equations is used to study the possibility of non-symmetric equilibria in a topological torus, here an approximate rectangular parallelopiped, with periodicity in two of the three rectangular coordinates. An expansion is carried out in the deviation of pressure surfaces from planes. Resonances are manifest in the process. Nonetheless, provided the magnetic shear is small, it is shown that it is possible to select the magnetic fields and flux surfaces in such a manner that no singularities appear on resonant surfaces. One boundary surface of the parallelopiped is not arbitrary but is dependent on the equilibrium in question. A comparison of the solution sets of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric equilibria suggests that the latter have a wider class of possible boundary shapes but more restrictive rotational transform profiles.

The aim is to modify the perturbation (of order ε) locally by a small control term (of order ε2) which creates invariant tori acting as barriers to diffusion for Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. The location of the invariant torus is enforced in the vicinity of the chosen target (at a distance of order ε due to the angle dependence). Given the importance of confinement in magnetic fusion devices, the method is applied to two examples with a loss of magnetic confinement. In the case of locked tearing modes, an invariant torus can be restored that aims at showing the current quench and therefore the generation of runaway electrons. In the second case, the method is applied to the control of stochastic boundaries allowing one to define a transport barrier within the stochastic boundary and therefore to monitor the volume of closed field lines. © 2006 IAEA, Vienna.},

	abstract = {General three-dimensional toroidal ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibria with a continuum of nested flux surfaces are susceptible to forming singular current sheets when resonant perturbations are applied. The presence of singular current sheets indicates that, in the presence of non-zero resistivity, magnetic reconnection will ensue, leading to the formation of magnetic islands and potentially regions of stochastic field lines when islands overlap. Numerically resolving singular current sheets in the ideal MHD limit has been a significant challenge. This work presents numerical solutions of the Hahm-Kulsrud-Taylor (HKT) problem, which is a prototype for resonant singular current sheet formation. The HKT problem is solved by two codes: a Grad-Shafranov (GS) solver and the SPEC code. The GS solver has built-in nested flux surfaces with prescribed magnetic fluxes. The SPEC code implements multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD), where the solution relaxes to a Taylor state in each region while maintaining force balance across the interfaces between regions. As the number of regions increases, the MRxMHD solution approaches the ideal MHD solution assuming a continuum of nested flux surfaces. We demonstrate excellent agreement between the numerical solutions obtained from the two codes through a thorough convergence study.},

Plasmas 19 112502) has been successful in the construction of equilibria in 3D configurations that contain a mixture of flux surfaces, islands and chaotic magnetic field lines. In this model, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes separated by ideal interfaces, and in each volume the magnetic field is a Beltrami field. In the cases where the system is far from possessing a continuous symmetry, such as in stellarators, the existence of solutions to a stepped-pressure equilibrium with given constraints, such as a multi-region relaxed MHD minimum energy state, is not guaranteed but is often taken for granted. Using SPEC, we have studied two different scenarios in which a solution fails to exist in a slab with analytic boundary perturbations. We found that with a large boundary perturbation, a certain interface becomes fractal, corresponding to the break up of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surface. Moreover, an interface can only support a maximum pressure jump while a solution of the magnetic field consistent with the force balance condition can be found. An interface closer to break-up can support a smaller pressure jump. We discovered that the pressure jump can push the interface closer to being non-smooth through force balance, thus significantly decreasing the maximum pressure it can support. Our work shows that a convergence study must be performed on a SPEC equilibrium with interfaces close to break-up. These results may also provide insights into the choice of interfaces and have applications in finding out the maximum pressure a machine can support.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, a variational principle based on a generalisation of Taylor's relaxation, referred to as multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHDs) has been developed. The numerical solutions of the MRxMHD equilibria have been constructed using the Stepped Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC) (Hudson et al 2012 Phys. Plasmas 19 112502). In principle, SPEC could also be established to describe the MRxMHD stability of an equilibrium. In this work, a theoretical framework is developed to relate the second variation of the energy functional to the so-called Hessian matrix, enabling the prediction of MHD linear instabilities of cylindrical plasmas, and is implemented in SPEC. The negative and positive eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix predict the stability of an equilibrium. Verification studies of SPEC stability results with the M3D-C 1 code and the tearing mode Δ′ criterion have been conducted for ideal and resistive MHD instabilities, respectively, in a pressureless cylindrical tokamak, and have shown good agreement. Our stability analysis is a critical step towards understanding the MHD stability of three-dimensional MHDs where nested flux surfaces, magnetic islands and stochastic regions co-exist.},

Plasmas 19 112502) requires a fast and robust solver to obtain the Beltrami field in three-dimensional geometry such as stellarators. The spectral method implemented in the stepped pressure equilibrium code (SPEC) is efficient when the domain is a hollow torus, but ill-conditioning of the discretised linear equations occurs in the (solid) toroid due to the artificially singular coordinate parameterisation near the axis. In this work, we propose an improved choice for the reference axis to prevent coordinates surfaces from overlapping. Then, we examine the parity and asymptotics of the magnetic vector potential near the axis and suggest the use of recombined and rescaled Zernike radial basis functions. The maximum relative error in the magnetic field of the Wendelstein 7-X geometry is shown to reach 10−9 at high resolution in a series of convergence tests and benchmarks against the boundary integral equation solver for Taylor states. The new method is also reported to significantly improve the accuracy of multi-volume SPEC calculations. A comparison between free-boundary SPEC and the analytical Dommaschk potential is presented with higher-than-usual Fourier resolution. It is illustrated that we are able to resolve low amplitude current sheets when an interface is placed where there is no flux surface in the analytic solution. This was previously concealed because of insufficient numerical resolution},

While the magnetic helicity is not a good invariant for tearing modes, we show that the saturated tearing mode can be obtained as an MRxMHD state of a priori unknown helicity by appropriately constraining the current profile. The predicted saturated island width in a tearing-unstable force-free slab equilibrium is shown to reproduce the theoretical scaling at small values of Δ ′ and the scaling obtained from resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations at large Δ ′.},

Thus, its applicability, particularly for the analysis of the highly interesting and highly complex plasma edge, is limited. For a revised set of analytical formulae, the procedure to determine the analytical formulae described by Sauter is repeated with the more accurate and more reliable numerical code NEO [E.

The behavior of electron transport is found to be the same over a wide range of energies but the behavior of ion transport for low‐energy ions is found to be different than that for high‐energy ions. Furthermore, the electron fluxes do not vary with the change in the radial ambipolar electric field nearly as much as do the ion fluxes. Thus the particle diffusion is controlled by the electrons. A nonradial ambipolar electric field is induced by ion drift. This electric field enhances the transport by about 15\%–20\%. A convenient graphical method that allows one to determine the magnitude of the radial ambipolar field for machines with different parameters is presented. Numerical examples show that electron energy confinement time is comparable to the ion energy confinement time for all the different size stellarators studied. Although the neoclassical losses are large, it is shown that ignition can be achieved in a reasonably sized stellarator reactor. Finally, fron the standpoint of reactor economics, the confinement scaling law shows that in order to increase nτ, it is better to increase the aspect ratio than the overall dimensions of the reactor.},

Four distinct categories of stellarator optimization, two of which are novel approaches, are the fixed-boundary optimization, the generalized fixed-boundary optimization, the quasi-free-boundary optimization, and the free-boundary (coil) optimization. These are described using the MRxMHD energy functional, the Biot–Savart integral, the coil-penalty functional and the virtual casing integral and their derivatives. The proposed free-boundary equilibrium calculation differs from existing methods in how the boundary-value problem is posed, and for the new approach it seems that there is not an associated energy minimization principle because a non-symmetric functional arises. We propose to solve the weak formulation of this problem using a spectral-Galerkin method, and this will reduce the free-boundary equilibrium calculation to something comparable to a fixed-boundary calculation. In our discussion of combined plasma–coil optimization algorithms, we emphasize the importance of the stability matrix.},

The discussion is focussed on magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium conditions, collisionless particle orbits, and the kinetic theory of equilbrium and transport. Each of these topics is fundamentally affected by the absence of symmetry in the magnetic field: the field lines need not trace out nested flux surfaces, the particle orbits may not be confined, and the cross-field transport can be very large. Nevertheless, by tailoring the magnetic field appropriately, well-behaved equilibria with good confinement can be constructed, potentially offering an attractive route to magnetic fusion.

	abstract = {In the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator, the vacuum rotational transform, ι , has a flat radial profile and does not cross any major rational resonance. Nevertheless, during plasma operation the ι ‐profile can be strongly modified by electron cyclotron current drive in such a way that the resulting ι -profile passes through low-order rational values, and this can trigger magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) events. Indeed, W7-X plasmas are sometimes subject to repetitive collapses of core confinement, which can be observed regardless of the direction in which the EC current is driven. Even though the origin of these MHD instabilities is under investigation, the crashes may be connected to the formation of magnetic islands and magnetic reconnection. In the present work, we try to shed light on the dynamics of different events happening during the course of sawtooth cycles in W7-X by proposing a model that combines a slow current diffusion with a recipe for fast relaxation that conserves the corresponding helical flux (Kadomtsev 1975 Fiz. Plazmy 1 710–15). We also propose a simple model based on Taylor relaxation (Taylor 1974 Phys. Rev. Lett. 33 1139), (Taylor 1986 Rev. Mod. Phys. 58 741) to predict the nonlinear redistribution of plasma current caused by the largest of the observed events.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to calculate dose distributions from CyberKnife image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for brain, H\&N, lung, and pelvis treatment regions and use them to extract the corresponding effective dose and estimate-related risk. Methods: We developed a CyberKnife IGRT kV beam model in a standard treatment planning system and validated it against measurements in heterogeneous phantoms. Five brain, five head and neck, five thorax, and 10 (five male and five female) pelvis patient computed tomographies (CTs) were contoured. The dose distribution resulting from different CyberKnife IGRT protocols was calculated. From them, the effective dose was calculated according to ICRP publication Nr 103, using the average dose to contoured organs. The corresponding risk factors were calculated. Entrance surface dose (ESD) was also calculated and compared with existing data. Results: The maximum effective dose produced by CyberKnife IGRT protocols was 0.8 mSv (brain), 1.9 mSv (H\&N), 20.2 (pelvis), and 42.4 mSv (thorax) per fraction for a risk estimate of 0.004\% (brain), 0.01\% (H\&N), 0.1\% (pelvis), and 0.2\% (thorax). Calculated ESD were compatible with existing data. Conclusions: Dose calculation models for CyberKnife IGRT kV beams were implemented in a clinical treatment planning system and validated in water and heterogeneous phantoms. We determined the effective dose and the related risk estimate resulting from CyberKnife IGRT protocols for brain, head and neck, thorax, and pelvis cases. The effective doses calculated for CyberKnife IGRT protocols were similar to those obtained for cone beam CT protocols on conventional C-arm linear accelerators, except for extreme irradiation conditions for thorax cases (140 kV X-ray tube tension).},

These include the force-free singular current density represented by a Dirac ?-function, which presumably prevents the formation of islands, and the Pfirsch-Schl?ter 1/x singular current, which arises as a result of finite pressure gradient. An analytical model based on linearized MRxMHD is derived that can accurately (1) describe the formation of magnetic islands at resonant rational surfaces, (2) retrieve the ideal MHD limit where magnetic islands are shielded, and (3) compute the subsequent formation of singular currents. The analytical results are benchmarked against numerical simulations carried out with a fully nonlinear implementation of MRxMHD.},

Included are detailed analyses of MHD equilibrium and stability, with a particular focus on three key configurations at the cutting-edge of fusion research: the tokamak, stellarator, and reversed field pinch. Other new topics include continuum damping, MHD stability comparison theorems, neoclassical transport in stellarators, and how quasi-omnigeneity, quasi-symmetry, and quasi-isodynamic constraints impact the design of optimized stellarators. Including full derivations of almost every important result, in-depth physical explanations throughout, and a large number of problem sets to help master the material, this is an exceptional resource for graduate students and researchers in plasma and fusion physics.},

Both scenarios lead to restrictions either in the configuration space or in plasma parameters and ECRH heating scenarios. Furthermore, the flexibility of the magnetic configuration space of W7-X is briefly described with emphasis on other physics topics of interest, for example, ballooning unstable configurations as well as configurations with a magnetic hill which might lead to interchange instability.},

The ROSE code was written to carry out an optimisation based on an equilibrium evaluation using VMEC and several additional codes. This paper presents both a quasi-axially symmetric and a quasi-isodynamic equilibrium obtained with ROSE and demonstrates two important features that are new to stellarator optimisation. One allows the reduction of coil complexity by analysing a current sheet obtained with NESCOIL. The second is a new way of accounting for properties of the vacuum field while simultaneously optimising the finite beta equilibrium.},

	abstract = {© 2017 IAEA, Vienna. Computational optimization has revolutionized the field of stellarator design. To date, optimizations have focused primarily on optimization of neoclassical confinement and ideal MHD stability, although limited optimization of other parameters has also been performed. The purpose of this paper is to outline a select set of new concepts for stellarator optimization that, when taken as a group, present a significant step forward in the stellarator concept. One of the criticisms that has been leveled at existing methods of design is the complexity of the resultant field coils. Recently, a new coil optimization code - COILOPT++, which uses a spline instead of a Fourier representation of the coils, - was written and included in the STELLOPT suite of codes. The advantage of this method is that it allows the addition of real space constraints on the locations of the coils. The code has been tested by generating coil designs for optimized quasi-axisymmetric stellarator plasma configurations of different aspect ratios. As an initial exercise, a constraint that the windings be vertical was placed on large major radius half of the non-planar coils. Further constraints were also imposed that guaranteed that sector blanket modules could be removed from between the coils, enabling a sector maintenance scheme. Results of this exercise will be presented. New ideas on methods for the optimization of turbulent transport have garnered much attention since these methods have led to design concepts that are calculated to have reduced turbulent heat loss. We have explored possibilities for generating an experimental database to test whether the reduction in transport that is predicted is consistent with experimental observations. To this end, a series of equilibria that can be made in the now latent QUASAR experiment have been identified that will test the predicted transport scalings. Fast particle confinement studies aimed at developing a generalized optimization algorithm are also discussed. A new algorithm developed for the design of the scraper element on W7-X is presented along with ideas for automating the optimization approach.},

	abstract = {The two leading concepts for confining high-temperature fusion plasmas are the tokamak and the stellarator. Tokamaks are rotationally symmetric and use a large plasma current to achieve confinement, whereas stellarators are non-axisymmetric and employ three-dimensionally shaped magnetic field coils to twist the field and confine the plasma. As a result, the magnetic field of a stellarator needs to be carefully designed to minimize the collisional transport arising from poorly confined particle orbits, which would otherwise cause excessive power losses at high plasma temperatures. In addition, this type of transport leads to the appearance of a net toroidal plasma current, the so-called bootstrap current. Here, we analyse results from the first experimental campaign of the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, showing that its magnetic-field design allows good control of bootstrap currents and collisional transport. The energy confinement time is among the best ever achieved in stellarators, both in absolute figures (τE {\textgreater} 100 ms) and relative to the stellarator confinement scaling. The bootstrap current responds as predicted to changes in the magnetic mirror ratio. These initial experiments confirm several theoretically predicted properties of Wendelstein 7-X plasmas, and already indicate consistency with optimization measures.},

In the circular l = 2 stellarator W II-A, steady-state barium plasmas were investigated and were found to be governed by collisional diffusion. In W II-B, mainly Ohmic heating was applied. The main stellarator experiment at IPP Garching is W VII-A; after a period of Ohmic heating, the first net-current-free plasma was achieved in 1980. Plasma parameters of up to Tj= 1 keV and n(0) = 1014cm-3could be reached by this method. A further heating method is ECRH, which yields maximum electron temperatures of Te ≥ 2 keV.

Here n, T, and τ E are the ion density, ion temperature and energy confinement time respectively. However, tokamak plasmas are subject to operational limits and two important limits are a density limit and a beta limit. We show that when these limits are taken into account, nTτ E becomes almost independent of size; rather it depends mainly on the fusion power, P fus. In consequence, the fusion power gain, Q fus, a parameter closely linked to nTτ E is also independent of size. Hence, P fus and Q fus, two parameters of critical importance in reactor design, are actually tightly coupled. Further, we find that nTτ E is inversely dependent on the normalised beta, β N; an unexpected result that tends to favour lower power reactors. Our findings imply that the minimum power to achieve fusion reactor conditions is driven mainly by physics considerations, especially energy confinement, while the minimum device size is driven by technology and engineering considerations. Through dedicated R\&D and parallel developments in other fields, the technology and engineering aspects are evolving in a direction to make smaller devices feasible.},

Although the magnetic field strength B spectrum is dominated by a m/n = 1/0 component, the discrete filamentary coils trigger some small-amplitude symmetry-breaking components that can disturb the quasi-symmetry of B. Finite β causes the plasma column to shift outward in the absence of bootstrap current. With a self-consistent bootstrap current in the 1/v regime, the plasma becomes more elongated and more distorted in the horizontally elongated up-down symmetric cross section. At β ≃ 3.25\%, the plasma can be restored to its near-vacuum shape with the application of a vertical field with coil currents 20\% of those of the modular coils, but at the expense of a significant mirror component in the B-field spectrum. The bootstrap current causes the rotational transform ι profile to increase above the critical resonant value (ιc =1/2 for β ≥ 1.1\%) and combines with the Pfirsch-Schlüter current to destabilize a m/n = 2/1 external kink mode for β ≥ 1.8\%.},

In the design of the Quasi-Poloidal Stellarator (QPS), a code was used to predict the bootstrap current based on a calculation in an asymptotically collisionless limit. This calculation is believed to be a good approximation of the bootstrap current for low-collisionality plasmas but is expected to be higher than the actual bootstrap current for more collisional plasmas. A fluid moments approach has been developed to self-consistently calculate viscosities and neoclassical transport coefficients. The viscosities and transport coefficients can be used to calculate the bootstrap current for arbitrary collisionality and magnetic geometry. The bootstrap current calculations from the two codes were done for low-density, electron cyclotron-heated (ECH) plasmas and high-density, ion cyclotron-heated (ICH) plasmas for a range of configurations, and provide a benchmark for the moments code and a test of the range of validity of the collisionless code. In the configurations examined here, namely, QPS, the National Compact Stellarator Experiment, the Helically Symmetric Experiment, the Large Helical Device, and the Wendelstein-7X Stellarator, the bootstrap currents predicted from the two codes agree qualitatively for both ICH and ECH profiles.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Waiting imposes major risks on society and is unnecessary. Readiness is sufficiently revolutionary that many will assume that it can be dismissed without thought. But, those who are willing to read and to think will find the arguments simple and self-evident. The paper explains not only how stellarators are better positioned now than any other concept for a fast path to fusion but also areas in which further improvements can be quickly made to stellarators through computational design.},

For finite beta equilibria, flux surfaces become stochastic in the peripheral region. However, though the axis shifts until the conventional limit, the separatrix to limit the equilibrium does not appear. For high beta equilibria, the force balance starts breaking in the stochastic region. To keep the force balance, the pressure gradient in the stochastic region decreases and the fixed profile is reduced. As the result, the volume averaged beta saturates. The beta value, where the force balance starts breaking inside the stochastic region, is proposed as an index of equilibrium beta limit in heliotron plasmas.},

When a small but non-zero amount of perpendicular diffusion is included, the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld becomes less important, allowing pressure gradients to be supported across chaotic regions and island chains. We introduce a metric for the effective volume over which the local parallel diffusion dominates based on the solution to the anisotropic heat diffusion equation. To validate this metric, we consider model ﬁelds with a single island chain and a strongly chaotic layer for which analytic predictions of the relative parallel and perpendicular transport can be made. We also analyse critically chaotic ﬁelds produced from different sets of perturbations, highlighting the impact of the mode number spectrum on the heat transport. Our results indicate that this metric coincides with the effective volume of non-integrability in the limit κ⊥ → 0, where κ⊥ is the perpendicular diffusion coefﬁcient. We propose that this metric be used to assess the impact of non-integrability on the heat transport in stellarator equilibria.},

	abstract = {The bootstrap current for three electron cyclotron resonance heated plasma scenarios in a quasihelically symmetric stellarator (the Helically Symmetric Experiment) are analyzed and compared to a neoclassical transport code PENTA. The three conditions correspond to 50 kW input power with a resonance that is off-axis, 50 kW on-axis heating and 100 kW on-axis heating. When the heating location was moved from off-axis to on-axis with 50 kW heating power, the stored energy and the extrapolated steady-state current were both observed to increase. When the on-axis heating power was increased from 50 kW to 100 kW, the stored energy continued to increase while the bootstrap current slightly decreased. This trend is qualitatively in agreement with the calculations which indicate that a large positive electric field for the 100 kW case was driving the current negative in a small region close to the magnetic axis and accounting for the decrease in the total integrated current. This trend in the calculations is only observed to occur when momentum conservation between particle species is included. Without momentum conservation, the calculated bootstrap current increases monotonically. We show that the magnitude of the bootstrap current as calculated by PENTA agrees better with the experiment when momentum conservation between plasma species is included in the calculation. The total current was observed in all cases to flow in a direction to unwind the transform, unlike in a tokamak in which the bootstrap current adds to the transform. The 3-D inductive response of the plasma is simulated to predict the evolution of the current profile during the discharge. The 3-D equilibrium reconstruction code V3FIT is used to reconstruct profiles of the plasma pressure and current constrained by measurements with a set of magnetic diagnostics. The reconstructed profiles are consistent with the measured plasma pressure profile and the simulated current profile when the reconstruction is constrained by the measured data from a diagnostic array that is internal to the vacuum chamber.},

The DAx state, which has a nontrivial topology, has not previously been reproduced using an equilibrium model that preserves this topological structure.

The effectiveness of this mechanism is demonstrated via large-scale gyrokinetic simulations, revealing an overall turbulence reduction by up to 65\% in the case under consideration. Comparisons with a tokamak configuration highlight the critical role played by the magnetic geometry and the first steps into the optimization of fast particle effects in stellarator devices are discussed.

This operational limit was determined by power balance and impurity radiation without noticeable degradation of stability or a violent collapse. The partial reduction of neoclassical transport could be verified in agreement with calculations indicating the feasibility of the concept of drift optimization. A full neoclassical optimization, in particular a minimization of the bootstrap current was beyond the scope of this project. A variety of non-ohmic heating and current drive scenarios by ICRH, NBI and in particular, ECRH were tested and compared successfully with their theoretical predictions. Besides, new heating schemes of overdense plasmas were developed such as RF mode conversion heating—Ordinary mode, Extraordinary mode, Bernstein-wave (OXB) heating—or 2nd harmonic O-mode (O2) heating. The energy confinement was about a factor of 2 above ISS95 without degradation near operational boundaries. A number of improved confinement regimes such as core electron-root confinement with central T e ≤ 7 keV and regimes with strongly sheared radial electric field at the plasma edge resulting in T i ≤ 1.7 keV were obtained. As the first non-tokamak device, W7-AS achieved the H-mode and moreover developed a high density H-mode regime (HDH) with strongly reduced impurity confinement that allowed quasi-steady-state operation (τ ≈ 65 · τ E ) at densities \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/50/5/053001/ppcf224941in001.gif] \{{\textbackslash}bar \{n\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rme\} {\textbackslash}cong 4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{20\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mbox\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\} (at 2.5 T).

That is, the shape of the plasma edge, assumed to be a magnetic surface, was kept fixed as the solution iteratively converges to equilibrium. This condition somewhat restricts the possible applications of SIESTA. In this paper, we discuss an extension that will enable SIESTA to address free-plasma-boundary problems, opening up the possibility of investigating problems in which the plasma boundary is perturbed either externally or internally.

Two modes of operation are considered: a zero-net-current stellarator and a fixed-iota stellarator. Despite the fact that relaxation is allowed (Taylor, Rev. Mod. Phys., vol. 58 (3), 1986, pp. 741-763), the former is shown to maintain good flux surfaces up to the equilibrium β-limit predicted by ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), above which a separatrix forms. The latter, which has no ideal equilibrium β-limit, is shown to develop regions of magnetic islands and chaos at sufficiently high β, thereby providing a 'non-ideal β-limit'. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the value of β at which the Shafranov shift of the axis reaches a fraction of the minor radius follows in all cases the scaling laws predicted by ideal-MHD. We compare our results to the High-Beta-Stellarator theory of Freidberg (Ideal MHD, 2014, Cambridge University Press) and derive a new prediction for the non-ideal equilibrium β-limit above which chaos emerges.},

Two basic scenarios to reconcile this are investigated with respect to equilibrium, stability and boundary structures. The first scenario with freely evolving bootstrap current realizes proper divertor operation by adjusting the vacuum magnetic field. As the bootstrap current evolves on the L/R time scale (40s) this needs long discharges. The second scenario compensates the net current by proper ECCD keeping the boundary structures basically constant sacrificing the low-shear ι-profile (mismatching ECCD and bootstrap current). Both scenarios seem to be viable experimental candidates.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the large subunit (26S) rRNA gene D1/D2 domain sequences showed that strain YJ2E(T) was located in a clade together with Candida haemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii.

The new strains differed from their closely related described species by more than 10\% mismatches in the D1/D2 domain. No sexual states were observed for the four strains on various sporulation media. The new species are therefore assigned to the genus Candida and described as Candida alocasiicola sp. nov.

In this paper, we introduce a Hessian matrix approach for determining error field sensitivity to coil deviations. A primary cost function used for designing stellarator coils, the surface integral of normalized normal field errors, was adopted to evaluate the deviation of the generated magnetic field from the desired magnetic field. The FOCUS code (Zhu et al 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 016008) is utilized to provide fast and accurate calculations of the Hessian. The sensitivities of error fields to coil displacements are then determined by the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. A proof-of-principle example is given on a CNT-like configuration. We anticipate that this new method could provide information to avoid dominant coil misalignments and simplify coil designs for stellarators.},

	doi = {10.1088/0741-3335/58/1/014021},
	abstract = {(abridged) Magnetic reconnection is the topological reconfiguration of the magnetic field in a plasma, accompanied by the violent release of energy and particle acceleration. Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves, with solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years, the theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid systems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of reconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated the field for {\textasciitilde}50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent, bursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation and ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model reconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm is that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the Lundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual shift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently unstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current sheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first place. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent reconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper provides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in reconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework. We briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected applications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at the frontier of this subject. Amongst these are the analytical and numerical extension of the plasmoid instability to (i) 3D and (ii) non-MHD regimes. New results are reported in both cases.},

In MRxMHD a linear Grad--Shafranov equation applies, even at finite ripple amplitude. The adiabatic switching on of boundary ripple excites a shielding current sheet opposing reconnection at a resonant surface. The perturbed magnetic field as a function of ripple amplitude is calculated by invoking conservation of magnetic helicity in the two regions separated by the current sheet. At low ripple amplitude "half islands" appear on each side of the current sheet, locking the rotational transform at the resonant value. Beyond a critical amplitude these islands disappear and the rotational transform develops a discontinuity across the current sheet.},

The fairly large set of diagnostic systems running in the end of the 10 weeks operation campaign provided first insights into expected and unexpected physics of optimized stellarators.},

More pre- cisely, equilibria with cylindrical symmetry are investigated for their po- tential to be a relaxed state. Such equilibria are characterized by their pinch ratio µ, the jump δ of the pitch angle of the magnetic field across the plasma–vacuum interface, a constant plasma pressure β, and the ratio l of wall radius over interface radius. In the limit of an infinitely long cylinder the necessary and sufficient condition for the equilibrium to be a relaxed state defines one or two intervals of allowed values of the pinch ratio µ, which depend still on the other parameters. These intervals are contained in the interval known from Taylor’s theory, but are generally smaller. They are shrinking with increasing plasma pressure β or increasing radius ratio l. In particular, in the field-free limit case β = 1, for l exceeding the critical value lc ≈ 4.983, or for a vanishing δ, these intervals are zero.},

Far from the rational surfaces, a procedure based on linearization in the plasma pressure applies. This yields the solution in terms of δ-function currents at the surface. These currents are found by a nonlinear analysis valid in the vicinity of the island. The result is a set of coupled nonlinear equations determining the island widths. Scaling is found by using the approximation of nearly circular flux surfaces. The results indicate that for typical stellarators, which have a small ratio Łl o/m o of field line rotational transform to coil rotational transform, the island size in the low-β limit depends dramatically on whether a magnetic well is present. In this case, if a magnetic well is present, islands are insignificant; in contrast, if a magnetic hill is present, island overlap occurs for arbitrarily low pressure. © 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

The edge magnetic structure in the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and Wendelstein 7X (W7-X) stellarators has been shown to have a significant impact on the particle fueling and exhaust of the plasma main species (hydrogen) as well as impurity helium. For HSX, the plasma sourcing to exhaust ratio, quantified by the effective and global particle confinement times s Ã p and s p;H , respectively, increases when a magnetic island chain is located in the plasma edge. The fueling efficiency is reduced by 25\% when the plasma boundary is deformed by the magnetic islands. The X-point geometry also yields higher plasma temperatures in front of the main recycling region. When the island is moved radially inward, both s Ã p and s p decrease by 10\%-25\% depending on plasma density. The s p;H results rely heavily on EMC3-EIRENE modeling which confirms reduced fueling efficiency due to more rapid ionization in the outward shifted island position. These findings suggest that for a helically optimized system like HSX, the plasma fueling from the recycling source, as well as from active gas injection, can be controlled by the magnetic island chain in the plasma edge-which is a basic requirement for a divertor system. This process is also effective for the control of effective helium exhaust times, as s Ã p;He measured by perturbative gas puff experiments is reduced by up to 40\% when the islands are shifted inwards. For Wendelstein 7-X, a similar reduction of s Ã p;He was inferred when magnetic islands were moved from the far plasma edge into the confined plasma region. However, the effective confinement features of H as the main plasma species were not affected due to the non-optimal position of the magnetic islands with respect to the highly localized ionization domain during the limiter startup campaign.

The source of that disagreement has been investigated, and that investigation has led to new insights into the domain of validity of the different equilibrium calculations, and to a finding that the manner in which localized screening currents at low order rational surfaces are handled can affect global properties of the equilibrium solution. The perturbative treatment has been found to break down at surprisingly small perturbation amplitudes due to overlap of the calculated perturbed flux surfaces, and that treatment is not valid in the pedestal region of the DIII-D shot studied. The perturbative treatment is valid, however, further into the interior of the plasma, and flux surface overlap does not account for the disagreement investigated here. Calculated equilibrium solutions for simple model cases and comparison of the 3D equilibrium solutions with those of other codes indicate that the disagreement arises from a difference in handling of localized currents at low order rational surfaces, with such currents being absent in VMEC and present in the perturbative codes. The significant differences in the global equilibrium solutions associated with the presence or absence of very localized screening currents at rational surfaces suggests that it may be possible to extract information about localized currents from appropriate measurements of global equilibrium plasma properties. That would require improved diagnostic capability on the high field side of the tokamak plasma, a region difficult to access with diagnostics.},

	abstract = {The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor is the product of a conceptual design study aimed at reducing the size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion Pilot power plant. ARC is a ∼200-250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q{\textless}inf{\textgreater}p{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ≈ 13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ∼63\%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ∼23 T peak field on coil achievable with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio ≥ 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits an output blanket temperature of 900 K, single phase fluid cooling, and a high efficiency helium Brayton cycle, which allows for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.},

(1) Even a small toroidal asymmetry in the magnetic field strength, δ ≡ ∂ ln B/∂φ ∼ 10-4, can cause an unacceptable degradation in performance. (2) Nevertheless, asymmetries - even large asymmetries δ ∼ 1 - can give beneficial plasma control and circumvent issues, such as magnetic-configuration maintenance and plasma disruptions, that make axisymmetric fusion devices problematic. Viewed from prospectives that are adequate for designing and studying axisymmetric plasmas, the physics of non-axisymmetric plasmas appears dauntingly difficult. Remarkably, Maxwell's equations provide such strong constraints on the physics of toroidal fusion plasmas that even a black-box model of a plasma answers many important questions. Kinetic theory and non-equilibrium thermodynamics provide further, but more nuanced, constraints. This paper is organized so these constraints can be used as a basis for the innovations and for the extrapolations that are required to go from existing experiments to fusion systems. Outlines are given of a number of calculations that would be of great importance to ITER and to the overall fusion program and that could be carried out now with limited resources.},

Our investigations are carried out using a system code and also by analytical means. Further, we show that for the two qualitatively different global scalings that have been developed to fit the data contained in the ITER ELMy H-mode database, i.e. the normally used beta-dependent IPB98 y 2 scaling and the alternative beta-independent scalings, the power needed for high fusion performance differs substantially, typically by factors of three to four. Taken together, these two findings imply that lower power, smaller, and hence potentially lower cost, pilot plants and reactors than currently envisaged may be possible.

In the extended variational problem, one prescribes, in addition to the helicity and the magnetic fluxes whose conservation follows from the perfect conductivity of the wall, the fluxes whose conservation follows from the assumption that the plasma-vacuum interface is also perfectly conducting (if the wall is a magnetic surface, then one has the toroidal and the poloidal flux in the vacuum). Vanishing of the first energy variation implies a pressureless free-boundary magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with a Beltrami magnetic field in the plasma, and in general with a surface current in the interface. Positivity of the second variation implies that the equilibrium is stable according to ideal magnetohydrodynamics, that it is a relaxed state according to Taylor's theory if the interface is replaced by a wall, and that the surface current is nonzero (at least if there are no closed magnetic field lines in the interface). The plane slab, with suitable boundary conditions to simulate a genuine torus, is investigated in detail. The relaxed state has the same double symmetry as the vessel if, and only if, the prescribed helicity is in an interval that depends on the prescribed fluxes.

Our calculation in contrast does not use the Frenet–Serret frame. The transformation between the Garren–Boozer approach and cylindrical coordinates is derived, and the two approaches are shown to be equivalent if the axis curvature does not vanish.

The device parameters are as follows: the major plasma radius of 1.2 m, the average plasma minor radius of 0.1–0.2 m, the magnetic field strength on the magnetic axis of 1.5 T, the vacuum rotational transform of 0.2–0.8 with a low magnetic shear, and the magnetic well depth of1.5\% at the plasma edge, with heating systems such as ECH(0.5 MW), NBI(1.5 MW), and ICRF(2.5 MW).

	abstract = {The vanishing of the divergence of the total stress tensor (magnetic plus kinetic) in a neighborhood of an equilibrium plasma containing a toroidal surface of discontinuity gives boundary and jump conditions that strongly constrain allowable continuations of the magnetic field across the surface. The boundary conditions allow the magnetic fields on either side of the discontinuity surface to be described by surface magnetic potentials, reducing the continuation problem to that of solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The characteristics of this equation obey Hamiltonian equations of motion, and a necessary condition for the existence of a continued field across a general toroidal surface is that there exist invariant tori in the phase space of this Hamiltonian system. It is argued from the Birkhoff theorem that existence of such an invariant torus is also, in general, sufficient for continuation to be possible. An important corollary is that the rotational transform of the continued field on a surface of discontinuity must, generically, be irrational. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The two effects of the finite beta on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) configuration, the magnetic surface torus outward shift and the invasion of the stochastic region into the plasma core, are discussed. The former is qualitatively the same as that by the external vertical field control. According to the comparison between a theoretical prediction in the finite beta and the vacuum field calculation in the vertical field control, the latter effect is strongly affected by the nonaxisymmetric component of the equilibrium current. A theoretical prediction suggests that an MHD equilibrium beta limit different from the conventional one exists due to the lack of the equilibrium force balance in the stochastic region. The key parameters to improve the accuracy of the identification of the MHD equilibrium configuration are shown to be the identification of the toroidal current profile, the anisotropic pressure effect, and the identification of the plasma boundary shape.},

This beta value was instantaneously obtained by pellet injection and maintained for more than 10τE, whereas the steady-state plasma with a maximum 〈βdia〉 of 4.8\% was sustained for 85τE by gas-puff fueling. While it is theoretically predicted that stochastization of the peripheral magnetic field structure develops with an increment of 〈βdia〉, no serious degradation of the global confinement has been observed in the present 〈β dia〉 range. The several low-order MHD activities located in the periphery were enhanced with the beta value and sometimes affect the local profiles.

	abstract = {This paper is a summary of some of the major results from the Wendelstein 7-AS stellarator (W7-AS). W7-AS [G. Grieger, Phys. Fluids B 4, 2081 (1992)] has demonstrated the feasibility of modular coils and has pioneered the island divertor and the modeling of its three-dimensional characteristics with the EMC3/EIRENE code [Y. Feng, F. Sardei, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 44, 611 (2002)]. It has extended the operational range to high density (4× 1020 m-3 at 2.5 T) and high 〈Β〉 (3.4\% at 0.9 T); it has demonstrated successfully the application of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) beyond cutoff via electron Bernstein wave heating, and it has utilized the toroidal variation of the magnetic field strength for ion cyclotron resonance frequency beach-wave heating. In preparation of W7-X [J. Nührenberg, Trans. Fusion Technol. 27, 71 (1995)], aspects of the optimization concept of the magnetic design have been successfully tested. W7-AS has accessed the H-mode, the first time in a "non-tokamak" and has extended H-mode operation toward high density by the discovery of the high-density H-mode (HDH), characterized by H-mode energy and L-mode-level impurity confinement. In the HDH-mode quasisteady state operation is possible close to operational limits without noticeable degradation in the plasma properties. High- Β phases up to tpulse τE =65 have been achieved, which can already be taken as an indication of the intrinsic stellarator capability of steady-state operation. Confinement issues will be discussed with emphasis on the similarities to tokamak confinement (general transport properties, H-mode transition physics) but also with respect to distinct differences (no confinement degradation toward operational boundaries, positive density scaling, lack of profile resilience, no distinct isotope effect, H-mode operational window). W7-AS turned out to be an important step in the development of the Wendelstein stellarator line towards an independent fusion power plant concept. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Besides fulfilling this research mission, the extrapolation from Wendelstein 7-X to a stellarator reactor will depend on the comparison with the results from other stellarators, the ITER results and here in particular the experience gained with α-particle heating and operating a nuclear device, and the possibility to extrapolate these results by first principle theory.},

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {A major objective of the experimental program in the last phase of the W7-AS stellarator was to explore and demonstrate the high-β performance of advanced stellarators. MHD-quiescent discharges at low impurity radiation levels with volume averaged β-values of up to ?β?= 3.4\% have been achieved. A very important prerequisite was the attainment of the high density H-Mode (HDH) regime. This was made possible by the installation ofextensive graphite plasma facing components designed for island divertor operation. The co-directed neutral beam injection provided increased absorbed heating power of up to 3.2MW in high-β plasmas with B ? 1.25 T. The anticipated improved features concerning equilibrium and stability at high plasma β could be verified experimentally by the comparison of x-ray data with free boundary equilibrium calculations. The maximum β found in configurations with a rotational transform around ?ι = 0.5 is determined by the available heating power. No evidence ofa stability limit has been found in the accessible configuration space, and the discharges are remarkably quiescent at maximum β, most likely due the increase of the magnetic well depth. An increase in low m/n MHD activity is typically observed during the transition towards high β. The beneficial stability properties of net-current-free configurations could be demonstrated by comparison with configurations where a significant inductive current drive was involved. Current driven instabilities such as tearing modes and soft disruptions can prevent access to β-values as high as in the currentless case. The experimental results indicate that optimized stellarators such as W7-X can be considered as a viable option for an attractive stellarator fusion reactor.},

The method is based upon quadratic-flux minimizing surfaces which pass directly through both the X and O points of the island chains. Using a suitable measure of island width, it is possible to utilize standard numerical optimization methods to achieve desirable configurations. A major island chain in the H-1NF heliac vacuum field has been made to both disappear and to reappear with opposite phase.

A wide range of parameters has been covered in the experiments with and without net toroidal currents. Experimental data are compared with free-boundary equilibrium calculations and exhibit good agreement. The high-β equilibria usually showed only small MHD activity. The most prominent activities are low-frequency pressure-driven modes connected with low-order rationals also expected from numerical calculations using the CAS3D code, and Alfvén modes driven by energetic particles from the tangential neutral beam injection. Comparison of experimentally measured frequencies and mode structures from soft-X-ray tomography with theoretical predictions also shows the improving understanding of these modes in stellarators.

Bootstrap currents in the range of tens of kAs can lead to the formation of unwanted magnetic island chains or stochastic regions within the plasma and alter the boundary rotational transform due to the small shear in W7-X. The latter issue is of relevance since the island divertor operation of W7-X relies on a proper positioning of magnetic island chains at the plasma edge to control the particle and energy exhaust towards the divertor plates. Two scenarios are examined with the new free-plasma-boundary capabilities of SIESTA: a freely evolving bootstrap current one that illustrates the difficulties arising from the dislocation of the boundary islands, and a second one in which off-axis electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) is applied to compensate the effects  of the bootstrap current and keep the island divertor configuration intact. SIESTA finds that off-axis ECCD is indeed able to keep the location and phase of the edge magnetic island chain unchanged, but it may also lead to an undesired stochastization of parts of the confined plasma if the EC deposition radial profile becomes too narrow.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review article is to demonstrate via a few simple models the mechanism for a very general, universal instability - the Arnold diffusion-which occurs in the oscillating systems having more than two degrees of freedom. A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations. The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the systsm. The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation. This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance. All models are treated both analytically and numerically. Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method-the overlap criterion-to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics. © 1979.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to bridge the gap between tokamak reactor design and plasma physics. The analysis demonstrates that the overall design of a tokamak fusion reactor is determined almost entirely by the constraints imposed by nuclear physics and fusion engineering. Virtually, no plasma physics is required to determine the main design parameters of a reactor: a, R0, B0, Ti, Te, p, n, τE, I. The one exception is the value of the toroidal current I , which depends upon a combination of engineering and plasma physics. This exception, however, ultimately has a major impact on the feasibility of an attractive tokamak reactor. The analysis shows that the engineering/nuclear physics design makes demands on the plasma physics that must be satisfied in order to generate power. These demands are substituted into the well-known operational constraints arising in tokamak physics: the Troyon limit, Greenwald limit, kink stability limit, and bootstrap fraction limit. Unfortunately, a tokamak reactor designed on the basis of standard engineering and nuclear physics constraints does not scale to a reactor. Too much current is required to achieve the necessary confinement time for ignition. The combination of achievable bootstrap current plus current drive is not sufficient to generate the current demanded by the engineering design. Several possible solutions are discussed in detail involving advances in plasma physics or engineering. The main contribution of the present work is to demonstrate that the basic reactor design and its plasma physics consequences can be determined simply and analytically. The analysis thus provides a crisp, compact, logical framework that will hopefully lead to improved physical intuition for connecting plasma physic to tokamak reactor design.},

The LHD machine is treated as a standard configuration heliotron with an L = 2 planar axis. The effects of vacuum magnetic configurations, pressure profiles and the vertical field control method are studied. The equilibrium beta limit with consistent bootstrap current is quite sensitive to the magnetic axis location for finite beta, compared with the currentless cases. For a vacuum configuration with the magnetic axis shifted inwards in the torus, even in the high beta regimes, the bootstrap current flows to increase the rotational transform, leading to an increase in the equilibrium beta limit. On the contrary, for a vacuum configuration with the magnetic axis shifted outwards in the torus, even in the low beta regimes, the bootstrap current flows so as to reduce the rotational transform; therefore, there is an acceleration of the Shafranov shift increase as beta increases, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium beta limit. The pressure profiles and vertical field control methods influence the equilibrium beta limit through the location of the magnetic axis for finite beta. These characteristics are independent of both device parameters, such as magnetic field strength, and device size in the low collisional regime.},

The method is based on the self-adjoint property of the equations for driven perturbations of MHD equilibria and is similar to the Onsager symmetry of transport coefficients. Two versions of the shape gradient are considered. One describes the change in a figure of merit due to an arbitrary displacement of the outer flux surface; the other describes the change in the figure of merit due to the displacement of a coil. The method is implemented for several example figures of merit and compared with direct calculation of the shape gradient.

Here, instead, we directly construct magnetic fields in cylindrical coordinates that are quasisymmetric to leading order in the distance from the magnetic axis, without using optimization. The method involves solution of a one-dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equation, originally derived by Garren \& Boozer (Phys. Fluids B, vol. 3, 1991, p. 2805). We demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of this optimization-free approach by providing the results of this construction as input to the codes VMEC and BOOZ-XFORM, confirming the purity and scaling of the magnetic spectrum. The space of magnetic fields that are quasisymmetric to this order is parameterized by the magnetic axis shape along with three other real numbers, one of which reflects the on-axis toroidal current density, and another one of which is zero for stellarator symmetry. The method here could be used to generate good initial conditions for conventional optimization, and its speed enables exhaustive searches of parameter space.},

The main features of advanced stellarators are the optimized coil system which can be extrapolated to reactor size, improved properties of plasma equilibrium with reduced Shafranov shift and a stability limit which is sufficient to meet the requirements of a commercial fusion reactor. The key element to achieve these goals is the proper shape of the magnetic surfaces and minimization of the geodesic curvature of magnetic field lines. As a consequence, Pfirsch-Schlüter currents and radial particle transport are reduced. Neoclassical transport becomes small enough so that ignition is not endangered. The theoretical basis of the advanced stellarator is a systematic procedure to compute plasma equilibria with reduced Pfirsch-Schlüter currents. The close relation between neoclassical transport and viscous damping indicates that a reduction of geodesic curvature not only reduces radial transport but also leads to a reduction of viscous damping, and thus, facilitates the rotational spin-up of the plasma. For this reason achievement of shear flow and reduced anomalous transport may be expected in advanced stellarators. The paper discusses the various aspects of advanced stellarators and describes their basic properties.},

	abstract = {We develop a multiple interface variational model, comprising multiple Taylor-relaxed plasma regions separated by ideal MHD barriers. The magnetic field in each region is Beltrami, ∇ \{{\textbackslash}times\} B = μ B , and the pressure constant. Between regions the pressure, field strength, and rotational transform may have step changes at the ideal barrier. A principle motivation is the development of a mathematically rigorous ideal MHD model to describe intrinsically 3D equilibria, with nonzero internal pressure, using robust KAM surfaces as the barriers. This article chiefly addresses whether the stability of two interface configurations with continuous rotational transform, but vanishing interface separation, is different from the stability of a single interface configuration with jump in the rotational transform. To make the problem analytically tractable, we derive the equilibria and stability of a multi-interface plasma in a periodic cylinder, generalizing the cylindrical treatment of Kaiser and Uecker (2004 Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 57 1--17). For two interfaces with no jump in rotational transform, we show that one eigenmode has in-phase interface displacements, and an eigenvalue that converges to the single barrier case in the limit of vanishing interface width. The complementary eigenmode is out-of-phase, and highly unstable. Physically, the unstable eigenmode is driven by the parallel current, and caused by the high shear required to match the different rotational transform on each interface. In the limit that the interface separation vanishes, the shear and parallel current density become infinite, and the parallel current between the interfaces nonzero. Surfaces with out-of-phase displacements will then collide, unless the amplitude goes to zero as the interface separation goes to zero. These results suggest the hypothesis that KAM barriers with different irrational rotational transform on either side may be allowable without violating nonlinear stability.},

The full set of ideal-MHD constraints is applied only on a discrete set of toroidal magnetic surfaces (invariant tori), which act as barriers against leakage of magnetic flux, helicity, and pressure through chaotic field-line transport. It is argued that a necessary condition for such invariant tori to exist is that they have fixed, irrational rotational transforms. In the toroidal domains bounded by these surfaces, full Taylor relaxation is assumed, thus leading to Beltrami fields ∇\{{\textbackslash}times\}B = λB, where λ is constant within each domain. Two distinct eigenvalue problems for λ arise in this formulation, depending on whether fluxes and helicity are fixed, or boundary rotational transforms. These are studied in cylindrical geometry and in a three-dimensional toroidal region of annular cross section. In the latter case, an application of a residue criterion is used to determine the threshold for connected chaos.{\textbackslash}n},

This paper presents the current wall-embedded Langmuir probe system installed on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV), as well as the analysis tool chain used to interpret the current-voltage characteristic obtained when the probes are operated in swept-bias conditions. The analysis is based on a four-parameter fit combined with a minimum temperature approach. In order to reduce the effect of plasma fluctuations and measurement noise, several current-voltage characteristics are usually averaged before proceeding to the fitting. The impact of this procedure on the results is investigated, as well as the possible role of finite resistances in the circuitry, which could lead to an overestimation of the temperature. We study the application of the procedure in a specific regime, the plasma detachment, where results from other diagnostics indicate that the electron temperature derived from the Langmuir probes might be overestimated. To address this issue, we explore other fitting models and, in particular, an extension of the asymmetric double probe fit, which features effects of sheath expansion. We show that these models yield lower temperatures (up to approximately 60\%) than the standard analysis in detached conditions, particularly for a temperature peak observed near the plasma strike point, but a discrepancy with other measurements remains. We explore a possible explanation for this observation, the presence of a fast electron population, and assess how robust the different methods are in such conditions.},

Both methods are based on treating magnetic field-line flow as a 1½-dimensional Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian) dynamical system. In the quadratic-flux minimizing surface approach, the integral of the square of the action gradient over the toroidal and poloidal angles is minimized, while in the ghost surface approach a gradient flow between a minimax and an action-minimizing orbit is used. In both cases the almost-invariant surface is constructed as a family of periodic pseudo-orbits, and consequently it has a rational rotational transform. The construction of quadratic-flux minimizing surfaces is simple, and easily implemented using a new magnetic field-line tracing method. The construction of ghost surfaces requires the representation of a pseudo field line as an (in principle) infinite-dimensional vector and also is inherently slow for systems near integrability. As a test problem the magnetic field-line Hamiltonian is constructed analytically for a topologically toroidal, non-integrable ABC-flow model, and both types of almost-invariant surface are constructed numerically.},

Each discrete coil is represented as an arbitrary, closed, one-dimensional curve embedded in three-dimensional space. A target function to be minimized that includes both physical requirements and engineering constraints is constructed. The derivatives of the target function with respect to the parameters describing the coil geometries and currents are calculated analytically.

First, neoclassical phenomena are computed for the LHD and W7-X stellarators using several versions of the drift-kinetic equation, including the commonly used incompressible-E × B-drift approximation and two other variants, corresponding to different effective particle trajectories. It is found that for electric fields below roughly one third of the resonant value, the different formulations give nearly identical results, demonstrating the incompressible E × B-drift approximation is quite accurate in this regime. However, near the electric field resonance, the models yield substantially different results. We also compare results for various collision operators, including the full linearized Fokker-Planck operator. At low collisionality, the radial transport driven by radial gradients is nearly identical for the different operators; while in other cases, it is found to be important that collisions conserve momentum.},

	abstract = {Research on magnetic confinement of high-temperature plasmas has the ultimate goal of harnessing nuclear fusion for the production of electricity. Although the tokamak1 is the leading toroidal magnetic-confinement concept, it is not without shortcomings and the fusion community has therefore also pursued alternative concepts such as the stellarator. Unlike axisymmetric tokamaks, stellarators possess a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field geometry. The availability of this additional dimension opens up an extensive configuration space for computational optimization of both the field geometry itself and the current-carrying coils that produce it. Such an optimization was undertaken in designing Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)2, a large helical-axis advanced stellarator (HELIAS), which began operation in 2015 at Greifswald, Germany. A major drawback of 3D magnetic field geometry, however, is that it introduces a strong temperature dependence into the stellarator’s non-turbulent ‘neoclassical’ energy transport. Indeed, such energy losses will become prohibitive in high-temperature reactor plasmas unless a strong reduction of the geometrical factor associated with this transport can be achieved; such a reduction was therefore a principal goal of the design of W7-X. In spite of the modest heating power currently available, W7-X has already been able to achieve high-temperature plasma conditions during its 2017 and 2018 experimental campaigns, producing record values of the fusion triple product for such stellarator plasmas3,4. The triple product of plasma density, ion temperature and energy confinement time is used in fusion research as a figure of merit, as it must attain a certain threshold value before net-energy-producing operation of a reactor becomes possible1,5. Here we demonstrate that such record values provide evidence for reduced neoclassical energy transport in W7-X, as the plasma profiles that produced these results could not have been obtained in stellarators lacking a comparably high level of neoclassical optimization.},

	abstract = {The multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD) has been successful in the construction of equilibria in three-dimensional (3D) configurations. In MRxMHD, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes separated by ideal interfaces, each undergoing relaxation, allowing the formation of islands and chaos. The resulting equilibrium has a stepped pressure profile across sub-volumes. The stepped pressure equilibrium code (SPEC) (S R Hudson et al, Phys. Plasmas 19, 112502 (2012)) was developed to calculate MRxMHD equilibria numerically. In this work, we have extended the SPEC code to compute MRxMHD equilibria with field-aligned flow and rotation, following the theoretical development to incorporate cross-helicity and angular momentum constraints. The code has been verified for convergence and compared to a Grad–Shafranov solver in 2D. We apply our new tool to study the flow profile change before and after the sawtooth crash of a reversed-field pinch discharge, in which data of the parallel flow is available. We find the promising result that under the constraints of cross-helicity and angular momentum, the parallel flow profile in post-crash SPEC equilibrium is flat in the plasma core and the amplitude of the flow matches experimental observations. Finally, we provide an example equilibrium with a 3D helical field structure as the favoured lower energy state. This will be the first 3D numerical equilibrium in which the flow effects are self-consistently calculated.},

              . The routine access to high plasma densities was opened with boronization of the first wall. After boronization, the oxygen impurity content was reduced by a factor of 10, the carbon impurity content by a factor of 5. The reduced (edge) plasma radiation level gives routinely access to higher densities without radiation collapse, e.g. well above
              
                
              
              line integrated density and
              
                
              
              central temperatures at moderate ECRH power. Both X2 and O2 mode ECRH schemes were successfully applied. Core turbulence was measured with a phase contrast imaging diagnostic and suppression of turbulence during pellet injection was observed.},

The techniques are aimed at controlling nuclear fusion for continuous energy production. While the focus is on the nonaxisymmetric toroidal field, or heliotron, developed at Kyoto University, the physics applies equally to other stellarators and axisymmetric tokamaks. The author covers all aspects of magnetic confinement, formation of magnetic surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium and stability, single charged particle confinement, neoclassical transport and plasma heating. He also reviews recent experiments and the prospects for the next generation of devices.},
